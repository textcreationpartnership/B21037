            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE OF <hi>Sextus Julius Frontinus,</hi> TO HIS Firſt three Books of the <hi>Stratagems of WAR.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAVING undertaken, amongſt ſome other Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers of the Art of War,
<note place="margin">He writ a Book of the Art of War.</note> to preſcribe and publiſh the Rules of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Knowledge: I conceive
<pb facs="tcp:45285:3"/>that I have ſufficiently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd my Deſign according to my Ability: but to this Work I judge alſo that I ought to annex the ſubtil Practices of great Captains, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> in one Word ſtile <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Stratagems, and to gather them together in ſhort and compendious Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for by this means Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may be furniſh'd with the Examples of Advice, Prudence and Conduct, which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Invention, and direct them to the Imitation of the ſame Exploits: and it will undoubtedly prevent their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of their own Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:45285:3"/>when they have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Examples before their eyes to ſpur on their Reſolutions. Now I am not ignorant, and cannot deny that the Hiſtorians have alſo comprehended in their Writings the ſame Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and have delivered to us all the moſt remarkable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but in my Judgment, we ought in this caſe to conſult the Conveniency of ſuch as are reduced to the Neceſſity of Speed and Action: for whom it would be then too tedious to run over all the things which are ſcatter'd here and there in the large Volumes of Hiſtories. And it uſually happens, that
<pb facs="tcp:45285:4"/>ſuch as have gathered and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of the moſt noted things, do loſe and forget them, as in a multitude of Matters which confounds the Readers. Our Induſtry therefore ſhall here endeavour to exhibit and lay down that which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to expectation as exactly as the things will ſuffer, for to the general Heads which I have gathered, I have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fit Advice and Counſel from Examples. And that thoſe things which are differing might be placed in good order for the variety-ſake of things, we have reduc'd them to three Books.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45285:4"/>
                  <p>In the firſt ſhall be the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which belong to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel not yet begun.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond ſhall be the Examples which relate to a Fight, and the concluding of a Peace.</p>
                  <p>The third contains the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems teaching how to begin, carry on, and raiſe a Siege.</p>
                  <p>Now under theſe general Heads I have placed certain Queſtions or Propoſitions, as ſo many Species relating to them; nevertheleſs, I may with Reaſon crave Pardon for this Work from him that ſhall find me not ſo curious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act as to ſet down every Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb facs="tcp:45285:5"/>for, Who is there able and ſufficient to reckon up all the Paſſages and Stories which are delivered to us in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin?</hi> Therefore I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omitted many things, which ſuch as have read over the Books of others who have undertaken the ſame things, may underſtand to have been done not without good cauſe. But it will be no hard matter to reduce every thing to its own Species; for as I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken this Work as well as others, not ſo much for my own Commendation as for the Benefit of other Men, I ſhall think my ſelf aſſiſted in my
<pb facs="tcp:45285:5"/>purpoſe by thoſe who can add to it, but in no wiſe diſgrac'd. If there be any delighted with the peruſal of theſe Stories, let them remember the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb facs="tcp:45285:6"/>in that Art and Subtilty uſed in defending our ſelves from an Enemy, or in overcoming him; concerning which things there have been remarkable Conſequences of excellent Sayings: therefore we have added to the Examples of Actions ſome noble Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. When <hi>C.

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> the Father, reſolving to have the chief of the <hi>Gabians</hi> deſtroyed, would not intruſt this Secret with any Perſon, and anſwered nothing to his Son's Meſſenger that was ſent to him, but with his Rod ſtruck off before him the heads of the higheſt Poppies, as he was then by chance walking in his Garden. The Meſſenger, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without a verbal Anſwer, told the young <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius</hi> what he obſerv'd that his Father did.

                     <p n="6">6.

Therefore, fearing that the <hi>Parthians</hi> would paſs over the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> to fight him, before his Legions could come up to him out of <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> from the other ſide of Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> he ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Traytor to a double Treachery, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Parthians</hi> to carry their Army over that part of <hi>Euphrates</hi> that bears the Name of <hi>Zeugma,</hi> where the River, leaving its ſtrait Channel; turns aſide; for if they came the nearer way, he aſſured them that <hi>Ventidius</hi> would make uſe of the Hills to defend himſelf and Army from the <hi>Parthian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; but, that he was very much afraid if they took the plain and open Fields. This Information oblig'd them to march the under way, and to bring their Army round about. They ſpent above forty days in ſiding along the larger Banks, in building of laborious Bridges, and in the carriage of their warlike Inſtruments. In the mean ſpace, <hi>Ventidius</hi> had time to call together his Troops; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Parthians</hi> were in ſight they had been with him three days. By this means he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45285:9"/>the <hi>Parthians</hi> in Battel, and kill'd their King <hi>Pacorus.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. When <hi>Pompey</hi> had begun to draw a Trench to compaſs in <hi>Mithridates</hi> with his Army, he prepared himſelf to fly the next day: but better to conceal this Deſign from the <hi>Romans,</hi> he cauſed his men to forage far and near, and to the places adjoyning to the Enemies Camp, and appointed a Conference the next day with ſeveral of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded more fires to be made every where in his Trenches; but in the ſecond Watch of the Night he led out his whole Army along by the Enemies Camp, and eſcaped.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Emperour <hi>Caeſar Domitianus Auguſtus,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Germanicus,</hi> having an intent to ſurpriſe the <hi>Germans</hi> that had took up Arms, and knowing that they would make a greater Preparation if they knew of the coming of ſo great a Captain, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the Taxation, or the muſtering of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> to be the cauſe of his Departure. In this manner he overcame them by an unexpected War, tamed the fierceneſs of barbarous Nations, and provided for the preſervation and ſafety of the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> deſired to cut in pieces the Army of <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> before he could joyn with his Brother <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he endeavour'd by haſty March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to unite with the other Conſul <hi>Livius Salinator,</hi> who was appointed to oppoſe <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> becauſe he miſtruſted the Forces that were under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: yet, would not he ſuffer <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom he was to oppoſe, to have any Intelligence of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. For that purpoſe, he choſe ten thouſand of the ſtouteſt Souldiers of his Army, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Lieutenants, whom he left behind, that they ſhould place the ſame Sentinels and Watches

By this means he overcame him and his Army, and with his increaſed Troops having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him unawares, returned back to wait upon the motions of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> before he could have any knowledge of the Victory. Thus he dealt with two of the moſt ſubtle Generals of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> the one he overcame by concealing his purpoſe, the other by his Valour he deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Themistocles,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain, adviſed his Citizens to build up with all ſpeed the Walls which the <hi>Spartans</hi> had commanded to be pull'd down: and to the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Ambaſſadours which were ſent to interrupt the Work, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he would go himſelf to <hi>Sparta,</hi> to give an account of this proceeding, and ſatisfie the Citizens. At his Arrival he pretended himſelf ſick, and by that means ſpun out ſome time; at laſt, when he perceived that they ſuſpected, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his delays, he affirmed to them, that they had heard falſe Reports, and deſired them to ſend ſome of their chief men who might give them a true Account of the Fortifications of <hi>Athens.</hi> And at the ſame time he writ to his Citizens privately to detain ſuch as ſhould come untill their Works were finiſhed, that he might then declare to the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> that <hi>Athens</hi> was fortified, and that their Citizens ſhould not be returned back, unleſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45285:10"/>they gave him liberty to be gone; which the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> eaſily granted, for fear that one mans Death ſhould be puniſhed with the loſs of many.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>L.

                     <p n="12">12. When <hi>Metellus Pius</hi> was asked in <hi>Spain</hi> what he would do the next day, he anſwered, That if his Waſtcoat could tell it, he would immediately caſt it into the fire.</p>

And that they might more freely take a view of the Camp, they let looſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45285:10"/>a Horſe for this purpoſe, which they followed, and by this means went round the greateſt part of their Fortifications; of which, when they had given an Account to <hi>Scipio,</hi> he made an end of that War, by ſetting Fire to their Camp.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Q.

                     <p n="3">3.

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. When <hi>M.

He choſe a ſelect number of his ſtrongeſt Souldiers, whom he warm'd with Wine and Oyl, commanding them to march along the Sea-ſhore, and to climb over the ſteepeſt Places. Thus he ſurpriſed the Guards behind unexpected, and maſtered them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. When <hi>Cn. Pompeius</hi> could not well paſs his Army over a River becauſe of the Enemies Troops, he often brought forth his Army out of their Trenches, and as often led them in again, that he might perſuade the Enemy that the <hi>Romans</hi> could find no way to march forwards. Then upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he gave an Onſet, and gain'd the Paſſage.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When <hi>Porus</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> King ſtop'd <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> with his Army, from paſſing the River <hi>Hydaſpes,</hi> he commanded his <hi>Greek</hi> Troops to run againſt the Stream: and when by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Porus</hi> was brought to take moſt heed and care of the other ſide of the River, on a ſudden he paſt over with his Army a little higher than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. The ſame <hi>Alexander,</hi> being hinder'd in the Paſſage of another River by the Enemy, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that ſeveral Troops of Horſe ſhould appear in ſeveral places on the ſides of the Water, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to paſs over. By that means he kept the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my employed, and expecting his motion there, whilſt he got into his Power an Iſland at a diſtance, firſt with a ſmall Guard, after with a greater, and from thence he commanded them to paſs over to the other ſide of the River. When all the Enemies were marching to encounter and deſtroy this ſmall Party, he had the Ford at liberty to get over with all his Army to joyn with his men on the other ſide.</p>

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his March found that the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſtood on the other ſide of a River to impede his Paſſage; he therefore commanded his men to ſeek out two Fords, and when he was oppoſed by the Enemy at the lower Ford, he returned to the higher; when likewiſe he was encountred there by the Enemy, he went back to the lower Ford, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a Party of his Men to remain there. While therefore the <hi>Armenians</hi> continued to defend the lower Ford, he paſs'd over at the higher; but they imagining that all would come down, they were deceived by thoſe that remain'd, for theſe, when the Ford was at liberty, they got on the other ſide without hinderance, and became a defence to all the reſt of their men whilſt they marched thro' the River.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>P.

                     <head type="sub">Example 1.</head>
                     <p>Q. <hi>Sertorius,</hi> being purſued by his Enemies to the ſide of a River which he was to paſs, cauſed a Bulwark to be caſt up in the manner of a half Moon on the Bank of the River, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it with combuſtible ſtuff, which he cauſed to be ſet on fire: by that means the Enemy was kept off, and he paſſed over without any hindrance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the like manner, <hi>Pelopidas</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> in the War of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> obtained a ſafe Paſſage over a River; for having ſhut in a large compaſs of ground within his Camp, he placed upon the Rampires and Baſtions round about, forked Stakes, with much combuſtible matter; and whilſt the Enemy was kept off by the Fire he got over to the other ſide.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Q. Lutatius Catulus,</hi> having received a Repulſe from the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> and ſeeing no hopes of Safety but in the paſſage of a River whereof the Banks were poſſeſſed by the Enemy, marched with his Troops to the next Mountain, as if he had intended there to ſettle his Camp; but commanded his Men not to lay down their Burdens, nor to looſen their Fardels, and that none ſhould offer to depart from their Ranks or Colours; and that he might better confirm the Enemy in this Perſuaſion, he ordered ſome few Tabernacles to be raiſed in the moſt conſpicuous places, and Fires to be kindled, and that ſome few of his men ſhould caſt up a Ditch, and others ſhould appear to go out to fetch Wood. All which Actions the <hi>Cimbri</hi> conceiving to be done in earneſt, choſe alſo a place to pitch their Tents, and ſent out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45285:15"/>ſeveral Parties to provide thoſe things that were needful for their abode: by this means they gave an opportunity to <hi>Catulus,</hi> not only to paſs over his Army, but alſo to ſtreighten the Enemies Camp.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When <hi>Craeſus</hi> could not get over a Ford of the River <hi>Halys,</hi> and having neither Ships, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to build a Bridge, he cauſed a deep Trench to be drawn in the upper part of the River behind his Camp, and ſo turn'd the Current of the Water behind him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> deſigning at <hi>Brunduſium</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and tranſport the War into <hi>Greece,</hi> becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> was likely to attempt upon his Troops when they ſhould endeavour to get on Ship-board, cauſed ſome ſtreets to be ſtopt up, in others he made Walls to be builded a-croſs, in others he cauſed Trenches to be drawn, and ſharp ſtakes, hardned in the fire, to be fixed in them, covering them over with Hurdles hid under the Earth which was caſt on the top. And ſome ways that led to the Haven he ſtopt with Beams laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another very thick. When all this was done, he made ſhew of a Reſolution to defend the Town, by placing ſome few Archers round the Walls. The reſt of his Troops, without noiſe, he commanded aboard, and when they were all ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the Archers likewiſe, by known ways, haſtened after him in ſmall Ships that waited for them in the Haven.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>C. Duillius,</hi> Conſ. enter'd into the Haven of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> unadviſedly, for he was ſhut in by a Chain croſs the Entrance; he cauſed therefore all his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to weigh down the Stern of his Ships, and when the fore-part was lifted up by the weight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, he cauſed the Oars to row that part over the Chain violently, which being done, all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45285:16"/>returned again to the fore-part to preſs that down: by this means all the weight of the Ships being got over the Chain, cauſed them to eſcape over it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When <hi>Lyſander</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> was beſieged with all his Navy in the Haven of <hi>Athens,</hi> being oppreſſed with the number of his Enemies Ships, he ordered his Souldiers to land ſecretly on that part of the Shore where the Sea hath the ſtreighteſt Paſſage to flow in, and his Ships to be placed upon Wheels, and carried over land to the neareſt Port named <hi>Monoecius,</hi> or rather <hi>Munychias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Herculeius,</hi> the Lieutenant of <hi>Sertorius</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> enter'd with a ſmall Party to march along a narrow way between two ſteep Mountains; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that a great number of his Enemies were at hand, coming againſt him, he cauſed ſpeedily a Ditch to be dig'd a croſs between the two Hills, and a Rampire made with combuſtible ſtuff to be ſet on Fire. Thus, while the Enemy was kept off with the Fire, he eſcaped.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> in the Civil War, leading his Army againſt <hi>Afranius,</hi> and finding that he was not able to retreat with ſafety, as he had deſigned, cauſed the firſt and ſecond Battalion ſecretly to withdraw themſelves behind his Army, and to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to dig a Trench of fifteen foot broad, into which, about Sun-ſet, he marched with his Army in Battel.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Pericles</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> being driven by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> into a certain place which was ſo ſurrounded with ſteep Hills that there were but two Paſſages to eſcape out, caus'd a Ditch to be dig'd of a very great breadth on one ſide, as if he had purpoſed to exclude the Enemy that ſide, on the other he commanded a way to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45285:16"/>made as if he had intended there to eſcape. The Beſiegers, never imagining that <hi>Pericles</hi>'s Army would offer to eſcape over the Ditch that he had drawn, reſolved all to oppoſe him in the broad way. But <hi>Pericles,</hi> having caſt over his Ditch a Bridge with Planks that he had ready, ſuddenly commanded over his Party that way where there was no reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> one of them who ſucceeded to the Wealth and Command of <hi>Alexander,</hi> deſigning to fix his Camp on a high Hill, by the Indiſcretion of his Officers was brought into a Valley, where he feared the coming down of his Enemies from the upper Ground; he therefore dig'd three Trenches againſt them within his Camp, and alſo round about all the Tents the like number of Ditches: By that means he ſtop'd the Enemies Paſſage, and by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bows over the Ditches, covering them over with Turf and Earth, he paſſed over, gave an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault to the Enemy, and got up to the higher Ground.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Cn.

He communicated his Reſolution and Purpoſe only to the firſt Ranks, and in the beginning of the night, at what time it was leaſt expected, he broke through the Enemies Poſt.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>L. Furius,</hi> having led his Army into a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult place, he reſolved to conceal the trouble of his Mind that the reſt might not be afraid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Men to march a little aſide, as if he had intended to aſſault the Enemy by taking a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er compaſs about: but by turning his Army round; who knew nothing of the matter, he brought them into ſafety.</p>

                     <p n="15">15. The ſame Courſe was obſerved under the Command of <hi>Attilius Calatinus,</hi> Conſ. by him whoſe Name is variouſly written; ſome call him <hi>Laberius,</hi> ſome <hi>Q. Caeditius,</hi> moſt write that he was named <hi>Calpurnius Flamma.</hi> This Captain, finding that his Army was led into ſuch a Valley that on every ſide the Enemy had taken poſſeſſion of the higher ground, deſired and obtained of the Conſul three hundred men, whom he encourag'd by their Valour to ſave the whole Army. With this Party he marched into the midſt of the Valley, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately all the Enemies ran down upon them to cut them off: ſo that while he was buſied in a very fierce and long Combate, he gave opportunity and leiſure to the Conſul to draw off his Army.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>L. Minutius,</hi> the Conſul, in <hi>Liguria,</hi> having led his Army into a ſtreight place, and every one did yet remember the ſad Deſtruction of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> called <hi>Caudinae Clades,</hi> commanded the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,</hi> his Auxiliary Troops, who were deſpicable in regard of the Deformity of their Perſons and of their Horſes, to ride up and down about the narrow Paſſage that led out of the Streights which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Enemy; firſt, they fearing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to Battel, ſtood to their Station, and kept
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45285:17"/>their Poſt, but the <hi>Numidians</hi> endeavour'd to cauſe themſelves to be deſpiſed, by falling purpoſely from their Horſes, and in playing ſtrange Tricks, as in ſport. At this unuſual ſight, the <hi>Ligurians</hi> began to open their Ranks, and to mind nothing but the ſeeing of the Play. The <hi>Numidians</hi> perceiving this, drew nearer and nearer; at laſt clapping the Spurs to their Horſes, they broke through the neglected and open Ranks or Stations of their Enemies, and then falling upon the neighbouring Country, forced the <hi>Ligurians</hi> to depart, and defend their Dwellings, and to ſuffer the <hi>Romans</hi> quietly to march out.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> in the War of the Confederates, near the City <hi>Eſernia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> was ſurpriſed in a ſtreight place; therefore he ſent to the Enemies Army, commanded by <hi>Duillius,</hi> for a Parley, and began to treat of the Conditions of Peace without any Succeſs; but perceiving the Enemy to be grown more negligent becauſe of the Truce, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in the night, leaving behind him his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, who was to divide the Watches as long as any ſhould remain behind, and at the fourth Watch ſhould follow him. Thus he brought away all his Army, with all their baggage and warlike Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, into ſafety.</p>

                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Haſdrubal, Hannibal</hi>'s Brother, being not able to get out of a Wood, whereof the Paſſages were ſtop'd by <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> began to treat with him, and to promiſe, that if he might be ſuffered
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45285:18"/>to depart, he would leave <hi>Spain.</hi> Afterwards he ſpent ſome days in finding fault with the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons impoſed. In the mean while, by certain nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Paths which were therefore neglected, he ſent away his Souldiers by Parties, and at the laſt he himſelf eſcaped with the reſt, that were the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateſt part of his Army.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>Spartacus</hi> marched over a little Trench with which <hi>M. Craſſus</hi> had incloſed him in by filling it up in the night with the Bodies of his Captives and of Beaſts.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The ſame Perſon being beſieged in Mount <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> eſcaped over the ſteepeſt and moſt crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy part, which was not therefore guarded, by twiſting together ſome Field Withies, of which he made Chains to ſlide down; and afterwards he ſo terrified <hi>Claudius</hi> on another ſide, that ſome of his Troops were put to flight by ſeventy four Fencers.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The ſame <hi>Spartacus</hi> being ſhut up by <hi>L.

Whilſt his Enemy was deceived with this vain Appearance, he led out in the night all his Army peaceably.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. <hi>Braſidas</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Captain, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed about <hi>Amphipolis</hi> by a great Multitude of <hi>Athenians,</hi> which he was not able to reſiſt; he therefore ſuffered himſelf to be ſhut in by them, that by extenuating their Body in a round Circle, he might break out through ſome part of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy where they were thinneſt.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> having placed his Camp in a low ground, underſtood that the Enemy had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45285:18"/>taken the next Hill, from which a Party was come to cut them off. He commanded his men to make many Fires, and left a few within his Camp in the Night for that purpoſe. In the mean while he led out his Army, and placed them along the ways on both ſides, through which he ſuffer'd the Enemy to paſs, and caught them in the ſame diſadvantageous place in which he was before. Thus he cut off ſome part of their Rear, and took the reſt in the Camp.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Darius,</hi> to hide from the <hi>Scythians</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, left behind him in his Camp the Dogs and the Aſſes; which while the Enemy heard barking and braying, they thought that <hi>Darius</hi> was yet there.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. The <hi>Ligurians</hi> deceived the <hi>Romans</hi> with a like Subtilty. In divers places they tied to the Trees wild Bullocks, which being left behind, by their frequent bellowing ſhewed the appearance of an Army to the Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. <hi>Hanno,</hi> being ſhut in by the Enemy, ſet on fire a great deal of light and combuſtible ſtuff in that place which was fitteſt for him to ſally out: And when he ſaw the Enemy gone to defend the other Paſſages, he led his Souldiers through the Flames, adviſing them to cover their Faces with their Bucklers, and their Legs with their Cloths.</p>

The <hi>Romans</hi> that went out firſt to examine the buſineſs, thought it a Prodigy, and a Wonder; afterwards, when they had given a true

The ſame <hi>Fulvius</hi> was purſued cloſe by his Enemy in the Rear, whilſt he was marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a River near at hand, which was not ſo great as to hinder his Paſſage, though the ſwiftneſs of the Stream did ſtop him. On the higher Banks he left one Legion in a ſecret place, that the Enemy might be more incourag'd to purſue after by the ſmall number, which they would infallibly deſpiſe;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45285:19"/>which accordingly happen'd; then the Legion which was placed on purpoſe came out of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado, aſſaulted and deſtroyed them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When <hi>Iphicrates</hi> led into <hi>Thracia</hi> a long Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, becauſe of the narrowneſs of the way, and News was brought to him that the Enemy would aſſault the Rear, he commanded ſome Companies to withdraw on both ſides, and there to ſtand, and the reſt to proceed on, and haſten ſpeedily their March; but when they paſſed by, he kept with him every choice Man; ſo that when the Enemy was buſie and ſcattered about the Prey, and already weary, he came upon them with his well-ordered and freſh Troops, routed them, and took from them all the Plunder.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Boii,</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> were to paſs through the Wood called <hi>Litana</hi> or <hi>Latina,</hi> had ſo cut the Trees that they ſtood upright, ſupported by ſuch a ſmall part, that at the leaſt violence they would fall, they being hid in the Borders of the Wood: when therefore their Enemies were enter'd in, they flung down the firſt, and theſe fulling broke down the next; by this means they caſt down a great many upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and cruſh'd a conſiderable Party to pieces.</p>

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> for the more convenient receiving of Supplies of Men and Proviſions, ſent <hi>Venticius Thermus</hi> to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to treat with him, while he in the mean ſpace went to help their landing.</p>

The next Morning he ſhewed their Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, and told his Men, that <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> had rid round about, and would be aſſiſting to them in the Battel.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When <hi>Pericles,</hi> the General of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> was to give Battel, he took notice that there was a Grove in the view of both Armies, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Thickneſs, and very dark and large, conſecrated to <hi>Pluto:</hi> in this place he put a Man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45285:25"/>of a large Stature, upon very high and big Slippers, with a purple Robe and long Hair, upon a great Chariot, dragg'd by two white Horſes, that when the Signal for the Battel ſhould be given, he might call <hi>Pericles</hi> by name, and encourage him, and promiſe him the Aſſiſtance of the Gods; which ſo terrified the Enemies, that before the caſting of their Darts they fled.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> that his Souldiers might be more ready to fight, pretended, that the Gods did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him things to come. And at laſt, in the ſight of his Army, before they entered into the Conflict, he would pray to an Image of a moderate Bigneſs which he had taken from <hi>Delphos,</hi> ſaying to it, that it ſhould make good and haſten the Victory that it had promiſed to him.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>C. Marius</hi> had a certain Magician Woman out of <hi>Syria,</hi> to tell him of the Succeſs and Events of Battels.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Q. Sertorius,</hi> having an Army of barbarous Souldiers, not governed by reaſon, led about <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> with him a white Hind, very large and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by which he told them that he underſtood the things that he was to do, and avoid; to the end that thoſe barbarous People might obey his Orders, as commanded from above.</p>
                     <p>We muſt not make uſe of this ſort of Stratagems only, when we are to deal with ſuch as we judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful and ignorant; but much more thoſe things are to be invented which may be of that kind that it may be believed that they have been diſcovered by theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> was to offer Sacrifice, he cauſed to be written with a Juyce, in that hand of the Diviner, which he was to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bowels of the Beaſt, ſuch Letters as did
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45285:26"/>ſignifie that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould have the Victory; which Letters appearing upon the hot Liver, was ſhewn by the King to the Souldiers, to encreaſe their Courage, as if the Gods did promiſe to him the Victory.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Innides</hi> the Soothſayer, did practice the ſame thing when <hi>Eumenes</hi> was to fight with the <hi>Gauls.</hi>

                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> encountring with the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> did think to encreaſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his Men with a Trick of Religion. The Arms and Weapons which were hung up to adorn the Temples, he cauſed to be ſecretly taken away in the Night, and perſuaded his Souldiers that the Gods had done it to follow and aſſiſt them in their Fight.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> having taken ſome <hi>Perſian</hi> Captives, whoſe Garb, when it was worn by them, did ſtrike a terror to his men, was wont to ſhew them all naked, that they might behold their white Skin and their groundleſs Fear together.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Gelo,</hi> King of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> having proclaimed a War againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and taken many of them Captives, was wont to produce the weakeſt of them all naked, chiefly of the Auxiliaries, who were black and ſwarthy, that his Souldiers might thereby learn to contemn them.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, that he might ſtir up the Minds of his Country-men, wearied them a whole day in cutting down a certain Wood, and the next day invited them to a moſt plentiful Feaſt, and asked them, which was moſt pleaſing to them; when they anſwered, that the preſent things were moſt grateful, he replied, By this alone you may attain to theſe things; you can never be free nor happy unleſs you overcome the <hi>Medes.</hi> By this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45285:26"/>perſwaſion he encouraged them to the deſire of fighting.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>L.

                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> fearing leſt his Souldiers ſhould have ſuch a Confidence in their Ships unto which they could fly for ſhelter, that this might hinder them in fighting, commanded them to be burned before he entered into the Battel.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> falling down by chance as he was landing out of a Ship, cried out, I hold thee faſt,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45285:27"/>O Mother Earth! By which Interpretation, he ſeemed to return to thoſe Lands from whence he was departed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>T.

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Q.

                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p n="6">6. The ſame <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> when a Flame fell from the Sky in the Night and terrified thoſe that were preſent, told them, that this Light did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Gods.</p>

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:45285:27"/>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>L. Sulpitius Gallus,</hi> when an Eclipſe of the Moon was at hand, that his Souldiers might not miſtake it for a Prodigy, gave them an account of it before, with the Reaſons and Cauſes of the Eclipſe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When <hi>Agathocles</hi> the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> warred againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> there happened a like Eclipſe of the Moon the Night before the Battel: and ſeeing his Souldiers troubled as at a great wonder, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with the Reaſons of the Eclipſe, and told them, that whatever ſhould happen did relate to the nature of things, and did not concern their Purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When there fell a Thunder-bolt into the Camp of <hi>Pericles,</hi> which terrified the Souldiers, he gathered them together, and before them all he beat two Stones one againſt another, and ſtruck Fire, and by that means quieted their Minds, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that in the like manner, by the violent motion of the Clouds the Thunder is produced.</p>
                     <p n="11">11.

                     </head>
                     <head type="sub">Example 1.</head>
                     <p>P. <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he was in <hi>Spain,</hi> underſtood that <hi>Haſdrubal,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General, had commanded his Army out to fight without their Breakfaſt; he therefore kept in his Men till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour of the day, and ordered them in the mean while to reſt and refreſh themſelves with food: and when the Enemy, tir'd with Hunger, Thirſt, and waiting, were marching again into their Camp, he led out ſuddenly his Army, gave them Battel, and routed them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When <hi>Metellus Pius,</hi> General in <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>Herculeius,</hi> ſaw that he brought forth his Men by break of day, before his Camp, in the hotteſt Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year, he kept in his Forces within his Camp, till the ſixth hour of the day: and when they were tired with the fervency of the Sun, he eaſily overcame with his freſh men ſuch as were thus wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſame <hi>Metellus,</hi> having joyned his Forces with thoſe commanded by <hi>Pompeius</hi> againſt <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> often drew up his Army in order of Battel, the Enemy in the mean while not judging himſelf able to encounter with both Generals. At laſt, when he ſaw that the Souldiers of <hi>Sertorius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded very furiouſly to fight, lifting up their Shoulders, and ſtretching out their Launces, he adviſed to give way for that time to their unuſual
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45285:29"/>Fervency, and to retreat into his Camp with his men, and perſwaded <hi>Pompey</hi> to do the like.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Poſthumius,</hi> the Conſul in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> encamped about three Miles from the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army. Their Generals drew up every day their Troops in order before the Fortifications of the <hi>Romans;</hi> but he entertained them always with ſmall Parties and light Skirmiſhes before his Works, untill the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my began to deſpiſe and grow inſolent by this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. Then, having provided all things needful in the night, according to his former Cuſtom, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Onſets of his Enemies with a few of his Men, and kept them in Play longer than ordinary. When they were ſufficiently tired out after the ſixth hour of the day, and they were ready to ſound a Retreat being very hungry, with his freſh Men he ſoon routed them that were overcome before with the forementioned Evils.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Iphicrates</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> underſtanding at what time the Enemies were diligently taking their Food, commanded his Men to diſpatch their eating ſooner, that he might lead them out to Battel. And having aſſaulted the Enemy, he ſo entangled them, that they could neither fight nor eſcape. At laſt, towards the Evening, he retreated with his Army, but kept them in Arms. The Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary with ſtanding upon their Guard, and Hunger, immediately haſted to refreſh themſelves with Reſt and Food. Then did <hi>Iphicrates</hi> lead out his Army, and aſſault the diſorder'd Enemy in their Camp.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ſame Perſon, being General againſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> pitched his Camp near to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and when both Parties were accuſtomed to march out at ſet times to bring in Wood and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, on a certain day he ſent out a Party of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45285:30"/>and Scullions to perform this Office and kept in his Souldiers; and when the Enemies were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to provide the ſame things, he took their Camp; and when they ran back in haſte at the noiſe of the Tumult, with their Burdens, he eaſily cut them in pieces or took them Priſoners.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Veriginius,</hi> the Conſul amongſt the <hi>Volſci,</hi> when he ſpied the Enemy running to them from far in diſorder, commanded his men to reſt with their Javelins fixed in the Ground: then when they were out of Breath, he charged them with the freſh Companies of his Army, and routed them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> knowing that the <hi>Gauls</hi> and the <hi>Samnites</hi> were uſed to prevail in the firſt Onſet, and that the Courage of his Men was not to be wearied out, but increas'd the more by the delays of fighting, commanded them to be content in the firſt Encounter, to defend themſelves, that by degrees they might weary the Enemy, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſucceeded: he then came on to aſſiſt them with the reſerve, and in the firſt Battalion, with all his Forces, he routed the oppreſſed Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. King <hi>Philip,</hi> in the Battel of <hi>Cheronca,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Souldiers were hardned by their long uſe of Arms, purpoſely drew in length the Fight that he had with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> which was fierce indeed, but without experience, and ſharp, becauſe of their furious Aſſault; but when the <hi>Athenians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to faint, he advanc'd more ſpeedily with his Colours, and cut them in pieces.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> underſtanding for certain that the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> were ſo enraged that they were come to fight againſt them with their Wives and Children, delayed the Fight till another time.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:45285:30"/>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> in the Civil War, when the Army of <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> was encloſed in by him, and wanted Water, and therefore provok'd to fight, when they had deſtroyed all their Carriages to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Battel, he kept in his men, judging it no fit time to fight when he had provok'd his Enemies to Anger and Deſpair.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> deſiring to force <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who was flying, to fight him, choſe to encounter him in the Night, and to ſtop him in his Retreat: and thus, being well prepared, he drove him ſuddenly to the Neceſſity of a Battel, and ſo drew up his Army, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> his men had the light of the Moon in their Faces, which ſhewed to the <hi>Romans</hi> more plainly their Enemies in the night.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. It is certain, that <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> not unmindful of the <hi>Romans</hi> Skill and Courage in Arms, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wont to begin a Fight towards the evening; that if his Men were beaten, they might have the advantage of the night to hide themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Lucullus,</hi> General againſt <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Tigranes,</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> the greater, near <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> finding that he had in his Army only fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men, and that his Enemies were an innumerable multitude, but unexperienc'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Fight, made uſe of their Weakneſs, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd them when they were out of order, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly routed them, in ſuch a manner, that the two Kings were forced to caſt away their Royal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to fly.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Cl. Tiberius Nero,</hi> fighting againſt the <hi>Pannoni,</hi> when thoſe barbarous People marched out furiouſly to the Battel by break of day, kept in his Men, and ſtaid till the Enemy was well beaten with Storms and Rain, which happened that day to be frequent.

                     <p>WHen <hi>M. Curius</hi> ſaw that he could by no means reſiſt the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> or the Body of ten thouſand <hi>Pikes</hi> of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> when they were joyned together in an open Field, ordered the matter ſo, that he was to fight in a ſtreight and narrow place, where being cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they might be an hinderance to one another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> choſe a place for his Camp in the higher Ground, that the proclivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Hill might aſſiſt the charging of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; ſo that by their running down he eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Mithridates</hi> and his Army.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> was to fight againſt <hi>Pharnaces</hi> the Son of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> he drew up his Men in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel on a Hill, which much facilitated the gaining of the Victory; for the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, caſting their Darts from the higher Ground upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, quickly cauſed them to turn their Backs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When <hi>Lucullus</hi> was to encounter with <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> and <hi>Tigranes</hi> in the greater <hi>Armenia</hi> near <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granacerta,</hi> he got poſſeſſion in haſte of a plain Ground which was on the top of a Hill, with part of his Troops, and then aſſaulted the Enemy which was under, charged their Horſe in the Flanks, and having driven part of them, and purſued them when they ran in and diſordered their Foot, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a moſt famous Victory.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45285:32"/>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Ventidius,</hi> General againſt the <hi>Parthian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would not lead out his Souldiers to the Fight till the Enemy was within fifty Paces, and then, by running ſuddenly upon them, he cloſed in with them ſo near, that he fruſtrated their Arrows which they made uſe of at a diſtance: by this proceeding he ſhewed ſuch an appearance of Confidence and Courage, that he quickly overcame thoſe barbarous People.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> was to fight againſt <hi>Marcellus</hi> at <hi>Numiſtro,</hi> he plac'd his Army amongſt the Pits and broken ways on one hand, and made uſe of the nature of the place as a Wall and a Defence. Thus he got the Victory, and overcame a moſt famous Captain.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When the ſame <hi>Hannibal,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> underſtood that the River <hi>Volturnus,</hi> beyond the nature of other Rivers, yielded ſtrong Winds in the Morning, which raiſed up great Clouds of Sand and Duſt, he drew up his Army in ſuch a manner, that all the violence of the Wind beat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Backs of his Men, and into the Faces and Eves of the <hi>Romans:</hi> by theſe Inconveniencies, which wonderfully incommoded the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, he got that remarkable Victory.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Marius,</hi> having appointed a day to fight againſt the <hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Teutones,</hi> placed before his Camp his Souldiers, ſtrengthened with Food, that by the little diſtance that was between them and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies their Army might be firſt overcome by their labour in gaining it: and beſides their wearineſs in running this ſpace, he gave them another Trouble; he drew up his Men ſo, that the Army of thoſe barbarous People had the Sun, the Wind, and the Duſt in their Faces.</p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:45285:32"/>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> General againſt <hi>Hippias</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who was the ſtronger in Horſe, cauſed Trees to be laid along the Plane where they were to fight, and rendered it unpaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Horſe.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Iberi</hi> were received by a vaſt multitude of the Enemies, and fearing that they ſhould be ſurrounded, marched to the ſides of a River which in that Country had high Banks. Thus being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended behind by the River, and excelling the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in Valour, they aſſaulted the firſt Ranks, and deſtroyed the whole Army of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Xanthippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> changed the Fortune of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War only by the change of a place; for when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were almoſt reduced to deſpair, they hired him to be their General. When he took notice that the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> who excelled and exceeded the <hi>Romans</hi> in Horſe and Elephants, drew up on the Hills, and that the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Strength conſiſted in their Foot, held the Valleys, he led the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> down to them, with his Elephants he diſordered their Ranks, and with the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horſe he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the diſperſed Souldiers, and routed their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, winning the ſame day a Victory both by Sea and Land.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. When <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> General, was leading his Army againſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> he cauſed a Party of Horſe to ride up and down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they might raiſe a great Duſt before the Enemies eyes: when they expected the Horſe to fall upon them, he led about his Foot Souldiers from that ſide where the Horſe were riding againſt the Enemy, and fell upon them ſuddenly in the Rear, and overcame them.</p>

                     <p n="13">13.

                     <head type="sub">Example 1.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CN. Scipio,</hi> General in <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>Hanno</hi> at the Town of <hi>Indibile,</hi> took notice that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army was ſo ordered, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were to fight in the right Wing, who were indeed the ſtouteſt Souldiers, but mercenary, and warred not for themſelves but for others; and that in the left Wing were the <hi>Africans,</hi> a weaker ſort of Men, but more reſolved: he therefore chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the left Wing of his Army for his right, which he had compoſed of the ſtrongeſt and ableſt Men, and encountered with the Enemies Army a-thwart. At laſt he routed the <hi>Africans,</hi> and eaſily forced the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who in the Retreat ſtood ſtill, as Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on, to ſurrender themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedo,</hi> fighting againſt the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> ſaw that the Front of the Enemies Army was very cloſe together, and compoſed of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt men taken out of the whole Army, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſides to be but weak: he therefore placed his beſt and ſtouteſt Men in his right Wing, and with them aſſaulted the left of the Enemies Army, routed and diſordered them, and got the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When <hi>Permenes,</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> Captain, took notice of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, that their ſtrongeſt Troops were in their right Wing; he drew up his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45285:34"/>Men in the ſame manner, he appointed all his Horſe, and the ableſt of all his Foot to be in the right Wing, and oppoſed the weakeſt of his againſt the ſtrongeſt of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and commanded them that at the firſt Charge they ſhould ſave themſelves by Flight, and retreat into the Woods and rocky Places. By this means he diſappointed the ſtrength of the Enemies Army, and with the beſt part of his Troops, in the right Wing, he encompaſſed about the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and overthrew them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> who was afterwards firnamed <hi>Africanus,</hi> made War againſt <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General in <hi>Spain,</hi> he led out his Army for ſeveral days ſo ordered in Battel, that the Body or Battalion in the middle was compoſed of his ſtrongeſt Men; but when the Enemy alſo came forth conſtantly diſpoſed in the ſame manner, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> that very day that he had appointed to fight, changed the Order of his Battel, and placed his ſtouteſt Souldiers, namely, his <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, in the Wings, and his Men who were ſlenderly armed in the middle, but ſomething behind the reſt. By this means, he aſſaulted with his two Wings, that were ſtrongeſt, and appearing like a half Moon, the weakeſt part of the Enemies Army, and eaſily rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Metellus,</hi> in that Battel wherein he overcame <hi>Herculeius</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> when he underſtood that his Enemies Troops that were eſteemed the ſtouteſt were placed in the middle, cauſed his Battalion that was oppoſite to draw back, that they might not come to fight with the Enemy untill their Wings were routed, and their main Body encloſed in on both ſides.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> marching againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who were entred into <hi>Perſia,</hi> becauſe he exceeded
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45285:34"/>them in number of Men, he ſtretched out his Army farther than the Enemies, and placed his Horſe in the Van, and ſuch as were lightly armed in the Wings; and thus he marched ſoftly on purpoſe with his middle Battalion, that he might encompaſs them: which when he had done, he cut them all in pieces.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Hannibal</hi> obſerved a contrary order in the Battel of <hi>Cannae;</hi> for he cauſed the middle Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to advance before, and kept back the Wings: by this means he overpower'd their Men at the firſt Charge. For this ſame General cauſed his Souldiers to fight cloſe together, and the Wings to wind about in the manner of a Half-Moon, and to march on at his Command; ſo that when the Enemy was earneſt in the purſuit, he encloſed them into the middle of his Army, fell upon them, and cut them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on all ſides, for his Souldiers were well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this manner of fighting, after a long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. None but ſuch Souldiers as are well skill'd and able to anſwer to every thing, can poſſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and obſerve this kind of Warfare.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Livius Salinator</hi> and <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> when in the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War <hi>Haſdrubal</hi> was unwilling to fight, and therefore had drawn up his Army upon a ſtony Hill behind a Vineyard; led their Forces up on all ſides, ſurrounded him on every hand, and without ſhelter aſſaulted and overcame him.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> had been in many Battels overpower'd by <hi>Claudius Marcellus,</hi> at laſt in his Marches he ſo placed his Camp, that he had the Aſſiſtance and Defence either of ſome Hill or Marſh Ground, or ſome other convenient place, and did draw up his Army in ſuch a manner, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> had the Advantage he could retreat with them into his Fortifications with little or no loſs;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45285:35"/>and when they were beaten, it was in his power and choice to purſue them.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Xanthippus,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> General in <hi>Africa</hi> againſt <hi>M. Attilius Regulus,</hi> placed his Men ſlenderly armed in the Van, and the Strength of his Army next to ſecond them, commanding his Auxiliary Troops, aſſoon as they had caſt their Darts to give Ground to the Enemy, and when they were retreated within their own Ranks, to run im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the ſides, and to charge from both Wings the Enemy that was at handy Blows with the Body of their Army, and to ſurround them in.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Sertorius</hi> practiced the ſame thing in <hi>Spain</hi> when he was fighting againſt <hi>Pompei.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Cleandridas,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> General againſt the <hi>Lucani,</hi> drew up his Men cloſe together that they might appear but a ſmall Body, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to the Enemy; but when the Battel was begun he cauſed his Men to open, and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed in the Enemy, he routed them.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. When <hi>Gastron</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> went to ſuccour the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that his <hi>Grecian</hi> Troops were ſtouteſt Souldiers and moſt feared of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to change their Arms, and to march in the Van; and when they encountered with the <hi>Perſians</hi> with equal Advantage, he ſent a Party of <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to ſecond them: when the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who were fighting with thoſe <hi>Grecians</hi> whom they thought to be <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> perceived the coming in of the Multitude, whom they eſteemed to be alſo <hi>Grecians,</hi> they run away for fear.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Cn. Pompcius,</hi> in <hi>Albania,</hi> becauſe the Enemy was powerful in Horſe and numbers of Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Souldiers to cover their Head pieces in a ſtreight place near a Hill, for fear they ſhould
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45285:35"/>be diſcovered by their ſhining in the Sun; and he commanded his Horſe-men to go down into the Plain and cover the Foot, and at the firſt Onſet of the Enemy, to give back till they were returned to the Foot, and then to place themſelves in the Wings; which being accordingly performed, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army aroſe, encounter'd with thoſe that were unadviſedly got in ſo far, who meeting with an unexpected Reſiſtance were cut all in pieces.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>M. Antonius,</hi> General againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> commanded his Men to ſtop when an innumerable company of Arrows were diſcharged upon them, and to cover themſelves over with their Targets, upon which when the Arrows fell, did no Injury to the Souldiers, and the Enemy was thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> encounter'd with <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> becauſe he had an Army compoſed of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> and Auxiliary Troops, ſome being come from divers Countries, and from <hi>Italy</hi> alſo; behind fourſcore Elephants, which he cauſed to march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Army to diſorder the <hi>Roman</hi> Ranks, he placed the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the <hi>Ligurians,</hi> the <hi>Baleares,</hi> and the <hi>Moors,</hi> that they might not be able to fly away, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being next behind, that they might in the firſt encounter with the Enemy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb or weary them; after them he placed his own Men and the <hi>macedonians,</hi> who might receive the tired <hi>Romans</hi> afreſh: and in the Rear he put the <hi>Italians,</hi> whoſe Conſtancy and Courage he ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he had drawn many of them out of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> againſt their Wills. <hi>Scipio,</hi> againſt this Order, drew up the ſtrength of the Legions in three Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in the Front, dividing them into <hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii;</hi> that is, firſt, Spear-men, next, ſuch as were of a gentile and noble Deſcent,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45285:36"/>laſt, another ſort of Souldiers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, who did commonly march and fight in the Rear. Neither were the Companies cloſe together, but he left a ſpace between every one that the Elephants that were driven againſt them by the Enemy might paſs by without diſordering the Ranks, and thoſe Intervals he fill'd up with ſuch Souldiers as were lightly armed, and nimble in Onſets and Retreats. This he did that his Army might not appear divided into ſeveral Bodies. He commanded theſe nimble Souldiers, that at the firſt approach of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants they ſhould retreat, and march to the ſides of the Battalions. He placed next his Horſe, and divided them into two Wings: the right, being <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Horſemen, he aſſign'd to <hi>Lelius;</hi> over the left, compos'd of <hi>Numidians,</hi> he appointed King <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa:</hi> which prudent Order was, no doubt, the Cauſe of the Victory.</p>
                     <p>It will not be unpleaſing to the Reader, to give here a ſhort Account of the drawing up of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Army, which procured him one of the moſt famous Victories of Antiquity, together with the Honour of the Triumph, and to the <hi>Romans</hi> the Dominion over their falſe <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Neighbours. <hi>T.

                     <p>In every Cohors or Company were three Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli, or ſmall Bands, each under one Captain or Centurion. I find ſome difference in the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors in the numbers of their Legions, and in their ordering of an Army. <hi>Romulus,</hi> their firſt Founder, as he was but a little Prince, his Army was but ſmall, and his Legion leſs. With the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Empire their Legions and Cohorts did increaſe in number. The Legion, as in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time, had 6000 men in it; and ſo proportionably their Cohorts were more numerous than formerly: but that which gave them a great Advantage over all other Nations, was, their Skill in drawing up of their Armies according to the Place and Enemy with whom they were to fight. <hi>Scipio,</hi> in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, appointed the Strength of his Legions to be in the Front; whereas other Generals uſe to place their chiefeſt Men in the Rear, or to keep them for the Reſerve. Take here a Scheme of each Legion of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Army, according to the Deſcription of <hi>Frontinus</hi> and <hi>Livy.</hi>

                     <p>They had that excellent way, that let the ground be never ſo unfit for a pitch'd Battel, they would bring them up in that order, that one Company was to ſecond another, and relieve ſuch as were weary or over-power'd, who could eaſily retreat without damage, and fall in the Rear. And though the difference of Arms now cauſeth us to differ much from their way, yet the wiſeſt Generals, as <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and others, have profeſs'd themſelves to be indebted to the <hi>Romans</hi> for ſome of their ſkill and cunning in ordering an Army.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Archelaus,</hi> fighting againſt <hi>Sylla,</hi> in the Front of the Battel appointed Carts, armed with Sythes, to break and diſorder the <hi>Roman</hi> Ranks; in the ſecond he placed his <hi>Macedonian Phalanx,</hi> or 10000 Pikemen; in the third Battalion were, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Method, the Auxiliary Troops, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the Fugitives come out of <hi>Italy,</hi> in whoſe Courage and Reſolution he had a great Confidence. In the Rear he drew up a Body of Souldiers lightly armed; and in the Wings he placed his Horſemen, of whom he had a great number, and ordered them to encloſe in the Enemy. But <hi>Sylla,</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, cauſed a large Ditch to be dig'd on each hand of his Army, and at the end of the Ditches he raiſed a Bulwark to defend it, to this end, that he might not be ſhut in with the vaſt numbers of the Foot, and chiefly of the Enemy's Horſe, who were ſtronger than his. Next, he divided his Foot into three Bodies, leaving Spaces between for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers lightly armed: and for his Horſe, he drew them up in the Rear, that when time ſhould ſerve he might ſend them out to charge the Enemy; and commanded the firſt Ranks of the ſecond Battel to fix faſt in the Ground many ſharp Stakes, thick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſo that when the Carts armed with Sythes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45285:38"/>drew near, he cauſed the foremoſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> to retreat within the Stakes before their Cohors, commanding at that inſtant the whole Army to give a ſhout, and the forlorn Hope to caſt their Darts. By this means the Enemies Carts were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtopped with the Stakes, or terrified with the extraordinary Shout and ſudden Aſſault, ſo that they turned back upon their own Men, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Array, which cauſed them to give ground, whereas <hi>Sylla</hi> maintain'd his. <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> at that moment charg'd with his Horſe; but when the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſemen encounter'd with them they put them to flight, and compleated the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> prevented in the ſame manner with Stakes fixed in the Ground the Carts of the <hi>Gauls</hi> which were armed with Sythes.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Alexander,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Arbella,</hi> fearing the numbers of his Enemies, and knowing the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of his own men, drew up his Army ſo as to receive the Enemy on every ſide, that in caſe he was encompaſſed in they might fight every way.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. When <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi> march'd againſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he ſaw that he had placed a double Phalanx or Body of Pikemen to charge in the middle, ſurrounded with Souldiers lightly arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on both Wings the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Horſe. Againſt this Order the <hi>Roman</hi> General divided his Army into three great Bodies, with ſome ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies drawn up in the form of a Wedge; between them he placed his Souldiers lightly armed: when he perceived that this did not profit him, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give Ground, that by this means he might draw the Enemy into ſtony and broken places, which he had choſen on purpoſe. But the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> miſtruſting the Retreat of the <hi>Romans</hi> to be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45285:38"/>out of Deſign, marched forward with their Body of Pikes in good order; then he commanded his Horſe to ride undiſcover'd out of ſight of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> Phalanx, and on the left hand of them, and to aſſault them with full ſpeed, that he might by the Furiouſneſs of the Charge, and the goodneſs of their Army, break and turn back the Enemies Pikes, which accordingly ſucceeded ſo well, that theſe Weapons were render'd uſeleſs to the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> ſo that they were forced to turn their Backs and fly.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. When <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> aſſiſted thoſe of <hi>Tarentum</hi> near <hi>Aſculum,</hi> according to the Saying of <hi>Homer,</hi> which teacheth to place the moſt Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the middle of a Battel, he appointed the <hi>Samnites</hi> and his own Country-men to be in the right Wing, in the left the <hi>Brutii</hi> and <hi>Lucani,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Salentini;</hi> but in the middle he drew up the <hi>Tarentini,</hi> and ordered his Horſe and Elephants to ſtand as a Reſerve. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls, in oppoſition to him, placed their Horſe excellently well in the Wings, the Legions in the Van and Rear; and amongſt them they mixed their Auxiliary Troops. In each Army, it is certain, there was forty thouſand men: <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> loſt half his Army, and the <hi>Romans</hi> about five thouſand.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. When <hi>Cn. Pompeius</hi> encounter'd with <hi>C. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> in the Fields of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he divided his Army into three Bodies, and every Body had ten Ranks in Latitude; the ſtrongeſt Legions, according to their Valour, he placed in the Wings, and between them, in the open ſpaces, he fill'd up with the new rais'd Troops; in the right Wing he ordered only ſix hundred Horſe becauſe of the River <hi>Enipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that overflowing its Banks had made Holes and Trenches on that ſide of the Country. The reſt of his Horſe he drew up in the left Wing with all his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45285:39"/>Auxiliaries, that he might encompaſs in on that ſide <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army. Againſt this Array <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> appeared with three Bodies of an Army, having put his Legions in the Front; and that he might not be encloſed in, he had on his left ſide a marſh Ground: in the right Wing he placed his Horſe, mingled with the nimbleſt of his Foot-men, who were uſed to fight with the Horſe; behind them he drew up ſome Companies of Foot to ſecond them, and to be employed on ſudden Occaſions; but the right Wing he cauſed to turn winding, that he might better receive the Onſet of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Horſe: which Order contributed very much to the getting the Victory; for when <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Horſe were broken in upon them, they ſallied out unexpectedly, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them aſide, and expoſed them to the Fury of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Foot.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The Emperour <hi>Caeſar Germanicus,</hi> when the <hi>Catti,</hi> a People of <hi>Germany,</hi> fled into their Foreſts, and aſſaulted the <hi>Romans</hi> only with their Horſe, commanded his Horſemen, aſſoon as they were come to the Baggage, to leap from their Horſes, and to fight on foot.

This Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a vaſt Multitude put ſuch a Terror into the Enemies, that they turned their Backs and fled.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Attilius Glabrio,</hi> Conſul, marching againſt the Army of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> which was coming into <hi>Achaia</hi> through the Streights of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> had been ſtop'd by the Enemy with confiderable loſs, becauſe of the diſadvantage of the place of Battel, had he not ſent round about <hi>M.

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>C.

He commanded them, that aſſoon as they ſaw the Battel begun, they ſhould come down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Backs of the Enemy.

                     <p n="8">8. When <hi>Marcellus</hi> was afraid that the ſmall number of his Men would be diſcovered by their hollowing, commanded all the Followers of his Army to encreaſe the hollowing: by this means he uſed to fright the Enemy with the Appearance of a great Army.</p>

                     <p>WHen <hi>Romulus</hi> went againſt the Town of <hi>Fidenae,</hi> he left a part of his Forces in Holes and Caves, and by a pretended Flight cauſed the Enemy to follow unadviſedly ſo far as his concealed Souldiers, who immediately roſe up, aſſaulted the unwary and diſperſed Enemy on all hands, and cut them in pieces.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> Conſul, being ſent to aid the Inhabitants of <hi>Sutrium</hi> againſt the <hi>Hetruſci,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd all the Enemies Troops to fall upon him, and afterwards in a ſeeming Fear retreated to a higher Ground; and when the Enemy purſued in a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner to the foot of the Hill, he fell upon them, and not only routed them, but took their Camp.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>T. Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> General againſt the <hi>Celtiberi,</hi> a People of <hi>Spain,</hi> pretended a Fear, and cauſed his Army to keep within their Fortifications, only he ſent out ſome of his Companies lightly arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſkirmiſh with the Enemy; but upon a ſudden he cauſed them to retreat in again; which cauſed the Enemy to follow in purſuit: then did he aſſault them in good order, and made ſuch a ſlaughter of them, that he took their Camp.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> Conſul, General in <hi>Sicily</hi> againſt <hi>Haſdrubal,</hi> was more wary and careful becauſe of the Enemies vaſt numbers, and one hundred and thirty Elephants which they had in their Army; he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45285:42"/>ſeemed to be therefore diffident of his own Forces, and kept his Army within the Town of <hi>Panormus,</hi> having drawn a Ditch of a very great breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Army: but after, when he ſaw in <hi>Haſdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s Army that in the Front the Elephants did march, he commanded the Spear-men to aſſault them with their Weapons, and to retreat immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately back again within their Fortifications. The Rulers of the Beaſts being moved by this offer of a Fight, and diſappointed, drove the Elephants into the very Ditch; in which they were no ſooner ſtop'd and entangled, but they were either kill'd by the multitude of Darts caſt at them, or driven back upon their own Army, which they diſordered. Then <hi>Metellus,</hi> waiting for this Opportunity, ſallied out of his Trenches with his whole Army, aſſaulted the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on all ſides, routed them, and took their Elephants.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Tamiris</hi> Queen of <hi>Scythia,</hi> fighting with <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> upon an equal Advantage, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fear led him into certain Streights, with which her Souldiers were well acquainted, and then turned back on a ſudden, and by the Aſſiſtance of the place overcame him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were to fight a Battel in Fields in which two Marſhes met, they hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Sedge: and when the Battel was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun they pretended to fly; but in the Flight brought into their Ambuſh the Enemy, who run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning furiouſly in unknown Ground, ſtuck faſt in the Mire, and by that means were circumvented.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Viriatus,</hi> who of a Robber turned General of the <hi>Celtiberi,</hi> a People of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeemingly fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, untill he had led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place full of Pits, and craggy, with which he was ſo well acquainted, that he eſcaped with his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45285:43"/>Party through a firm Path: then did he fall upon the <hi>Romans</hi> when they were faſt in the mire, and in a ground which they knew not, and cut them in pieces.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Fulvius,</hi> General in the <hi>Cimbrick</hi> War, having his Camp near adjoyning to the Enemies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Cavalry to ride up to their Trenches to provoke them to fight, and then to pretend to fly and retreat back: When he had practiſed this Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for certain days, the <hi>Cimbri</hi> followed them furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſo that he took notice that their Camp was not ſo well mann'd as before; therefore with part of his Army he cauſed his uſual Cuſtom to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, with another Party of light-harneſſed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers he marched to the other ſide of the Enemies Camp undiſcovered; and when he ſaw that they were gone out in Purſuit, as their manner was, he ſuddenly aſſaulted them, broke through the Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that were forſaken, and took the Camp.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Cn.

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Alexander</hi> marching out of <hi>Epirus</hi> againſt the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> placed a ſmall Party in Ambuſh, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome of his own Men, in the Habit of <hi>Illyrians,</hi> to deſtroy and burn his own Country of <hi>Epirus;</hi> which when the <hi>Illyrians</hi> ſaw, they began to ſcatter and to plunder every where; and the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, becauſe the Spoilers ſerved them as Scouts, who purpoſely decoyed them into an uneven ground, and ſet upon them, and routed them.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Leptenes,</hi> alſo General of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> commanded his own Country to be deſtroyed, and certain Villages and Caſtles to be ſet on fire, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> might think that this was done by their own Party, which cauſed them to march out to help, and to fall into an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh that routed them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Maharbal,</hi> being ſent General againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <hi>Africans,</hi> knew that they were greedy of Wine; He therefore cauſed a Veſſel of Wine to be ſeaſoned with Mandrake, that hath a ſtupifying Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue next to Poiſon. Afterwards, when he came to ſkirmiſh a little with the Enemy, he ſounded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat out of deſign, and in the dead of the night, having left in his Camp ſome of his Baggage and all his Wine, poiſoned with that Ingredient, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fly. When the barbarous Enemy had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Camp, they gave themſelves over to rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and to drink freely of the poiſoned Wine; which cauſed them to lye on the Ground ſtupified as dead. At that Inſtant <hi>Maharbal</hi> returned with his Army, took and ſlew them without reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> knowing that his own and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Camp was in a place that wanted Wood, leſt behind him purpoſely in a deſart place many Heads of Cattel within his Camp; of which, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had taken poſſeſſion, in this great want of Wood loaded themſelves with raw and unwholſome Meat. Then did <hi>Hannibal</hi> return in the night with his Army, and finding them ſecure and diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with raw Fleſh, he made a great ſlaughter of them.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. When <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> was General in <hi>Spain,</hi> he underſtood that the Enemy was poor, and wanted Trade; he left therefore his Camp fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all manner of Dainties for Food; which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45285:44"/>when the Enemy had taken, and fill'd themſelves without meaſure, he brought back his Army, and ſuddenly over-power'd them.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. They who made War againſt the <hi>Erythraeans,</hi> took one of their Scouts ſtanding in an Enemies place, and kill'd him, giving his Cloaths to one of their own Souldiers, who made ſuch Signs to the <hi>Erythraeans,</hi> as that they were brought thereby into an Ambuſcado.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Whereas the <hi>Arabians</hi> have a noted Cuſtom amongſt them, to ſignifie the coming of an Enemy, by day with Smoak, by night with Fire: they therefore ordered this to be continually practis'd, but when the Enemy was approaching to forbear the Cuſtom; who, when they ſaw no Fires, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that their Coming was not known: they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering therefore too haſtily into the Borders, were deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> when the Enemy had fortified their Camp in a high Wood, took a Party of his Men, commanding thoſe who were left behind to kindle Fires as formerly, and to ſhew the Appearance of the whole Army: in the mean while he led that ſelect Party by unknown ways round about to the higher Ground, from whence he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and drove away the Enemies.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Memnon</hi> King of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> being ſtronger than the Enemy in <hi>Calvary,</hi> and they abiding on Hills for ſhelter, reſolved to bring them down with this Policy: He ſent ſome of his Souldiers into their Camp, as Run-a-ways, to inform them that <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s Army was already vexed with a ſore Sedition, and that ſome part of it was already gone: and that he might confirm them in that belief, he ordered ſome little Forts in every ſide to be fortified in the Enemies ſight, as if they intended to refuge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45285:44"/>there who were at variance: when they who were in the Mountains heard of this, they came down upon the plain Ground, and while they were aſſaulting the Caſtles and Forts, they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the Cavalry of <hi>Memnon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Harridas,</hi> King of the <hi>Moloſſi,</hi> being at Wars with <hi>Ardies</hi> the <hi>Illyrian,</hi> who had a more numerous Army, ſent away all his weak People into the neighbouring Country of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> to diſperſe the ſame that he intended to deliver up his Cities and Wealth into the hands of the <hi>Aetolians:</hi> in the mean while he placeth all ſuch as could bear Arms in Ambuſh in the Mountains and rocky Places. The <hi>Illyrians,</hi> fearing leſt the <hi>Aetolians</hi> ſhould take poſſeſſion of all that belong'd to the <hi>Moloſſi,</hi> haſted to the Plunder without order. Then did <hi>Harridas</hi> come out of his Ambuſh, aſſaulted them unawares, and ſcattered up and down, routed, and put them to Flight.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>T. Labienus,</hi> while he was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Lieutenant againſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> before the Arrival of the <hi>Germans,</hi> whom he knew would come to their Aſſiſtance, deſired to fight with them, but made ſhew of being jealous of his own Forces; for that purpoſe he planted his Camp on the other ſide of the River, and appointed to march away on the next day. The <hi>Gauls</hi> thought that he had fled away; they reſolved therefore to paſs over the River that was between them. But while they were buſie in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the River, he had brought about his Army upon them, and cut them in pieces.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> underſtood that the Camp of <hi>Fulvius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General was negligently and ill provided, and that he was apt to attempt many things without Diſcretion; by break of Day, when the thick Miſts cauſed the Air to be dark, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45285:45"/>a few Souldiers to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sentinels, againſt whom <hi>Fulvius</hi> immediately marched with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: in the mean while <hi>Hannibal</hi> aſſaulted and took the Camp of <hi>Fulvius</hi> on the other ſide. By that means falling upon the back of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he cut off eight thouſand of their ſtouteſt Souldiers, with their General.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The ſame <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was divided between the <hi>Dictator Fabius</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> the Maſter of the Horſe, and that <hi>Fabius</hi> waited for a fair Opportunity, but <hi>Minutius</hi> deſired earneſtly to fight him, he placed his Camp in a Plain that was between the two Armies, and hid a Party of Foot amongſt craggy Rocks, whilſt he ſent out ſome Troops to invite forth the Enemy, and take poſſeſſion of an higher Ground near adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: when <hi>Minutius</hi> led forth his Army to cut them off, the Ambuſh which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had plac'd roſe up on a ſudden, and had defeated and deſtroyed <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi>'s Army if <hi>Fabius</hi> had not ſuccour'd them in their need.</p>
                     <p n="23">23.

Army through the River in a moſt bitter cold Seaſon, which made the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers ſhake; then did <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> encounter them with his Men, whom he had prepared with Fire, Oyl, and Food, when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

                     <p n="24">24. The ſame <hi>Hannibal,</hi> at the Lake <hi>Thraſyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> finding a narrow way that led to the Foot of a Mountain, and into open Fields, pretended to fly, and through the Streights he eſcaped into the level Ground, where he encamped; but in the night he appointed ſome Souldiers, and plac'd them about the Hill which was over him, and in the ſides of the Streights: the next Morning by break of day, being favour'd by a Miſt, he drew up his Army. <hi>Flaminius</hi> followed him as if he had fled; but when he was in the Streights he foreſaw not the Ambuſh till he found himſelf encompaſſed in before, behind, and on all ſides, and till his Army was totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. The ſame <hi>Hannibal,</hi> fighting againſt <hi>Junius</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> in the middle of the Night commanded ſix hundred Horſemen, divided into ſeveral Troops, in their turns, without ceaſing, to ſhew themſelves about the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp: by that means, when the <hi>Romans</hi> were tired by watching all night, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Rampires in the Rain, which then happened to fall continually, and when <hi>Junius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſound a Retreat, then did <hi>Hannibal</hi> lead on his Souldiers well refreſhed, and aſſaulted the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Camp.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> General, when the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> defended at <hi>Athmos</hi> the <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> with a Fortification in the ſame manner, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the Enemy all night by a few light armed Souldiers, and afterwards by break of day he drew up his Men when the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuddenly with his whole Army, which he kept quiet, he broke thro' their Fortifications naked of Defendants.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:45285:46"/>
                     <p n="27">27. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> having drawn up his Army at the Town of <hi>Cannae,</hi> commanded ſix hundred <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Horſemen to fly to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſſurance to them, delivered to them their Swords and Bucklers, falling back into the laſt Ranks: but when the Battel was firſt begun, they drew their ſhort Swords, which they had concealed for the purpoſe, and taking up the Bucklers of the ſlain, they fell upon the Back of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and deſtroyed them.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. <hi>Japyges,</hi> a People of <hi>Calabria,</hi> when <hi>P.

All this fell out according to his Expectation and Deſire.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. <hi>Mithridates,</hi> having been often overcome by the Valour of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> aſſaulted him in an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado, when he had corrupted and perſuaded a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man of great Strength, named <hi>Adathas,</hi> to fly to the Enemy.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45285:46"/>to a Run-away, neither was it fit to diſcourage others from coming over to them: afterwards, in many Sallies and Encounters having done good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he got himſelf into Credit.

An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident favour'd <hi>Lucullus,</hi> for he found him at that time departed to his Reſt, weary with his evening Cares and Employments, having entertain'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany very late: when therefore he offered to go in, as if he would reveal ſome ſudden and important Matter, he was reſolutely kept out by the Servants, who were mindful of their Lords Health and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which caus'd him to doubt that he was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; he therefore took Horſe, which he had ready before the Gate, and returned, without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting any thing, to <hi>Mithridates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="31">31. When <hi>Sertorius,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> near the Town of <hi>Lauro,</hi> had his Camp adjoyning to the Camp of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and that there was but two Countries only there able to furniſh them with Fodder, one near, the other at a diſtance; he cauſed his Souldiers lightly armed frequently to viſit that Country that was neareſt, but forbad them ſo much as to enter into that which was at a diſtance: by this means he made his Enemies believe, that the fartheſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was the ſafeſt; which, when the Souldiers of <hi>Pompey</hi> went to viſit, he ſent <hi>Octavius Graecimus</hi> with ten Companies armed in the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, and ten other Companies of <hi>Spaniards</hi> lightly armed, with <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus</hi> at the head of two thouſand Horſe, to lye in Ambuſh for the Forragers. They punctually and courageouſly performed their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for having well underſtood the Country, they hid theſe Forces in a neighbouring Wood in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45285:47"/>the Night; ſo that in the Front they placed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lightly armed, and fitteſt for a ſudden Surpriſe and Skirmiſh; next to them ſuch as carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bucklers, and in the Rear, the Horſemen: and that the neighing of the Horſes might not diſcover the Deſign, he commanded them to reſt and keep ſilence untill the third hour of the day. But when <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Souldiers were upon their return loaden with Fodder and ſecure, and that ſuch as kept the Guards were invited by the Quietneſs of the Enemy to march out and ſeek alſo for Forrage, firſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſallied out, and fell furiouſly, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Nation was, upon ſuch as were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring up and down, wounding and cutting them when they leaſt expected it. And before <hi>Pompey</hi> could reſiſt and ſtop them, the Party armed with Bucklers broke out of the Wood, and routed ſuch as were rallying together in ſome order: as they were flying, the Horſemen were ſent out to purſue and ſlay them all that ſpace that was between them and the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp; and there was care taken that none ſhould eſcape, for the other two hundred and fifty Horſemen, being ſent galloping before by a nearer way, returned, and met ſuch as were fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt, before they could come to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Camp. Aſſoon as <hi>Pompey</hi> underſtood it, he ſent out a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, commanded by <hi>Laelius,</hi> to ſuccour his Men; at whoſe approach, the Horſemen drew up on the right hand, as if they had given place: afterwards, they fell by this means upon the back of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, at the ſame time when ſuch as purſued after the Forragers met with it: thus was this poor Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion deſtroyed between two Parties of the Enemy: and when <hi>Pompey</hi> led out his whole Army to aſſiſt and relieve it, <hi>Sertorius</hi> alſo appeared with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on the top of the Hills, ready for the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45285:47"/>and hindered <hi>Pompey</hi> from proceeding farther: ſo that beſides a two-fold loſs procured by the ſame Policy, he ſtop'd and made him a Spectator of the Defeat and Deſtruction of his Men. This was the firſt Fight between <hi>Sertorius</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi> Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army were ſlain, and all their Carriages were loſt, ſaith <hi>Livius.</hi>

All which happening according to his deſire, with thoſe Troops that ſeem'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat he cut in pieces the middle Battalion of his Enemy which was out of order, and with his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that enter'd Pell-mell, he kill'd their Horſe; ſo that in that Battel he ruin'd the King's greateſt Truſt which he repos'd in his Horſemen.</p>

When <hi>Philippus</hi> was vanquiſhed in <hi>Epirus,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> might not preſs upon him in his Flight, he deſired and obtained a Truce to bury the ſlain; which made the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards to be the more negligent, and give him an opportunity to eſcape.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When <hi>Publ.

At this ſight the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> fancied that the <hi>Romans</hi> had gotten the Advantage of them; therefore for fear they ſuffered them to eſcape.</p>

By this Cuſtom the Townſmen were perſwaded that the <hi>Romans</hi> did practiſe this only to exerciſe themſelves: and when they never feared any thing from this conſtant March, the General turned the Walk into a ſudden Aſſault, in which they took the Walls, and obliged the Inhabitants to ſurrender themſelves and their Town.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>C.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Hannibal</hi> maſter'd many Towns in <hi>Italy</hi> by ſending before ſome of his own People in the Garb of <hi>Romans,</hi> who had got the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue by the long continuance of the War.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Arcades,</hi> beſieging a Caſtle of the <hi>Meſſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> made certain Arms in the reſemblance of their Enemies, and at that time that they found that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45285:63"/>their Guards were relieved, they furniſhed ſome of their own Party in the Habit of thoſe that were expected, and by this Miſtake, being received in as Companions, they got Poſſeſſion of the Place with the Slaughter of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Cimon,</hi> General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> having plac'd an Ambuſcado for a certain City in <hi>Caria,</hi> ſet on fire in the Night unexpectedly a Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> much reverenced by the Inhabitants, with a Grove adjoyning, which was without the Walls: when therefore the Citizens came out to extinguiſh the fire, he took the Town, being almoſt empty of its Inhabitants.</p>

And while he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the multitude under a pretence of conſulting with them, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whom he had provided for that Purpoſe, took Poſſeſſion of the City Walls.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> General in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> when the Women of the Enemies came out of the City on a Feſtival Day, and wander'd up and down in Companies, joyned to them ſome of his own Souldiers in the Garb of Women, who being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in that Habit within the Gates, towards the Night maſter'd the Town, and let in their own Men.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Aristippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> on the Feſtival Day of the <hi>Tegeatae,</hi> when a multitude were gone out of the Walls to celebrate the Services of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> ſent Beaſts loaden and filled with Sacks of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45285:63"/>Straw inſtead of Wheat, into the City, with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to drive them, who were under the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Merchants admitted, and they opened the Gates undiſcover'd to their own Men.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> took a Beaſt, which was come out of a Caſtle called <hi>Suenda,</hi> to fetch Wheat; and having kill'd the Drivers, he ſent with it his own Men in the Garb of thoſe Drivers, as if they had returned with the expected Grain. The Guards being cozen'd with this Deceit, ſuffer'd them to enter, and they made way for the Souldiers of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> having won a certain Inhabitant of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> named <hi>Soſiſtratus,</hi> to betray the City, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by him, that the Guards, the next day being a Feſtival, would be careleſs and negligent, and the rather, becauſe <hi>Epicides</hi> was to give them Plenty of Wine and good Cheer. He took there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Advantage of this merry Opportunity, and of the Negligence of the Guards, took the Walls, ſlew the Watch, and open'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army the Gates of this City, which had been famous for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral noble Victories.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> could not oblige the <hi>Gabii</hi> to yield to him, ſent to them his Son <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> beaten with Rods: He exclaim'd againſt the Cruelty of his Father, and perſuaded the <hi>Gabii</hi> to make uſe of his Hatred and Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt the King. They accordingly having
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45285:64"/>choſen him to be their Leader, betrayed them to his Father.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſent on purpoſe his Companion and Friend <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> upon whoſe Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he could aſſuredly relve, with his Face disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and maimed, to the Enemies. He was thought by them to be highly provok'd againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Diſgrace offered to him; and he did not a little encourage this Perſuaſion, by adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf much, as often as they went out to fight, and aiming at <hi>Cyrus</hi> with his Darts: at laſt, when they had made him Governour of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he deliver'd the City into the King's hands.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Philippus,</hi> being ſhut out of a Town of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mii,</hi> won <hi>Apollonius</hi> their Commander, to betray them, and perſuaded him to place a Cart full of ſquare Stones at the very Entrance of the Gate. At the making of a certain Sign, <hi>Philip</hi> ſuddenly came upon the Townſmen, who were buſie in ſhutting of their incomber'd Gate, and over-power'd them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he beſieged <hi>Tarentum,</hi> which was kept by <hi>Livius</hi> with a <hi>Roman</hi> Guard, ſollicited a certain Man of the City, named <hi>Eoneus,</hi> to betray it, and to practiſe this Subtilty; That he ſhould under pretence of Hunting, go out in the Night, becauſe it was not likely that the Enemy would ſuffer him in the Day. And when he was thus gone out, ſome did ſupply him with wild Boars, which he carried to <hi>Livius,</hi> as if they had been of his own taking. When he had practis'd this often, and therefore was not narrowly obſerved, on a certain Night <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſent in with him Souldiers of his Army in the Garb of Huntſmen; who being loaden with Veniſon, which they had in their Hands, they were admitted by the Guards, and ſuddenly they ſet upon them and ſlew them: Then the Gate was

                        <hi>Scipio,</hi> when <hi>Hannibal</hi> was returned into <hi>Africa,</hi> found that there were many Towns which in reaſon would be uſeful to him if taken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by ſtrong Gariſons of the Enemy: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent ſeveral Parties to block them up; at laſt he went thither with his Army, as if he had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſack the Cities; afterwards he ſeem'd to be afraid, and departed from them. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that his Fear was real, called together all his Gariſons, as if he intended to engage in a Battel. By that means <hi>Scipio</hi> had what he deſired; for by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> and his <hi>Numidians,</hi> he took thoſe Cities when their Gariſons were gone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>P.

By that means he brought it to paſs, that the Enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that their chief City was ſufficiently fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, went to the relief of the reſt. Then did he call together all his Forces, and finding the chief City
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45285:67"/>empty of its former Garriſons, he took it by force.</p>

                        <hi>SCipio,</hi> at the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> at the ebbing of the Sea, was wont to approach the Walls with his Army, following, as he pretended, the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps and leading of the God <hi>Neptune;</hi> but he broke into the Town through another quarter where he was not expected, when the Waters of the Lake were abated.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> the Cunctator's Son, ſent ſix hundred Souldiers in the dark of the Night, at the City <hi>Arpus,</hi> held by a Garriſon of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s, when he had confider'd the ſcituation of the Town, to that part of it which was beſt fortified, and therefore leaſt guarded, that they might climb up to the Walls, and break open the Gates.

                     <p>P. <hi>Scipio</hi> reformed the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, ſpoiled by the Slothfulneſs of their former Generals, by ſending away a vaſt number of their Servants and Slaves, and obliging the Souldiers to perform their daily Exerciſes and Offices. He commanded them likewiſe to march very often, and to carry the Food of many days with them; ſo that by that means the Souldiers were uſed to endure the Cold and Rain, and to paſs on foot through the Fords of Rivers. And the General did blame and exclaim againſt Timorouſneſs and Sloth, breaking all their uſeleſs Veſſels that were cumberſome in their Expeditions; which happen'd very remarkably to <hi>C. Mevius</hi> the <hi>Tribune,</hi> unto whom <hi>Scipio</hi> is reported to have ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt be an ill man to me for a little while, but to thy ſelf and the Common-wealth always.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> in the War againſt <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again the Diſcipline of War, which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe decayed, by imitating the ſame Severity, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the uſe of any other Fleſh to the Souldiers, but what was by himſelf ordered to be roſted and boiled.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> uſed to ſay to ſuch as he ſent to gather Souldiers, Chuſe me the ableſt Bodies, and I will make them ſtout and couragious.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When <hi>L. Flaccus</hi> and <hi>C. Varro</hi> were Conſuls, <hi>Livius</hi> names them <hi>L. Aemilius Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45285:80"/>Varro;</hi> then were Souldiers firſt made by taking an Oath, for before the cuſtom was for a Tribune or a Colonel to aſk of them whether they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves for the Service of their Country: Then did they agree together, and promiſe with a Curſe that they would never depart to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flight or for fear; and that they would never go out of their Ranks but to take their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to ſtrike an Enemy or to ſave a Citizen.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> ſaw a Buckler of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Souldier adorned more beautiful than the reſt, he told him that he did not wonder at his care and diligence in beautifying it becauſe he depended more upon it for his ſafety than upon his Sword.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When <hi>Philip</hi> firſt made up his Army, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them all the uſe of Waggons, and would not ſuffer a Horſemen to have more than one Servant, and to ten foot Souldiers he appointed likewiſe a Servant, who was to carry for them when they went out into the Field their Meat and their Ropes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to bear upon their Backs the Meal needful for thirty days.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>C. Marius,</hi> to ſhorten the Baggage and Carts of the Army which did moſt incumber it, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up the Souldiers Food and Veſſels needful in bundels, hanging them behind their Backs upon crooked Staves, which was eaſie for them to carry and lean upon: from hence is derived the Proverb, <hi>Muli Mariani,</hi> Marius<hi>'s</hi> Mules.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. When <hi>Theagenes</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> led an Army againſt <hi>Megara,</hi> he anſwered to thoſe that aſked for their Ranks and Places, that he would appoint them one there. He ſent afterwards his Horſemen before ſecretly, commanding them as Enemies to aſſault their own Friends; by this means he approved thoſe Souldiers that he had to meet and encounter with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45285:80"/>the Enemy. And he ſuffered them to rank themſelves as they pleaſed, ſo that whereas the moſt timerous did fall back in the Rear, and the ſtouteſt were found in the Front. As he found every man ſtanding in that manner, he advanced them to the Military Orders and Places.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Lyſander</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> reproving a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Soldier gone out of his way, had this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him, that he had not left his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to ſteal; but he replyed, I will not have thee give the leaſt ſuſpicion of Stealth.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When <hi>Antigonus</hi> heard that his Son was gone into a man's Houſe, who had Three Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Daughters; I hear, ſaid he, my Son, that thou haſt but a narrow Lodging where ſo many Dames do command the Houſe. Take, I adviſe thee, a larger Dwelling; and he ordered him to depart out; withall made a Law, that none ſhould, under Fifty years of Age in the Army, lodge in a dwelling Houſe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> the Conſul, though he was not hindred by any Law from receiving his Son al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in his Tent, yet he appointed him to fight, and to live as the other Soldiers, and to endure the ſame hardſhip.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>P. Rutilius</hi> the Conſul, though the Laws ſuffered him to have his Son with him in his Tent, yet he made him a Soldier in one of his Legions.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>T. Scaurus</hi> forbad his Son to come into his preſence, becauſe he had given back, and yielded Ground to the Enemy in a Wood near <hi>Trent.</hi> The young Man oppreſſed therefore with Grief and Shame kill'd himſelf.

But <hi>Pirrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> was the firſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched in an Army. Afterwards the <hi>Romans</hi> having beaten him in the Fields of <hi>Aruſina</hi> near the City <hi>Beneventum,</hi> and taken his Camp, they obſerved the manner of his pitching, and by degrees are now arrived to that perfection of Encamping which is now in uſe.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>P. Naſica</hi> being in his winter Quarters, tho he had no need of a Fleet, leſt the Soldiers ſhould be ſpoiled by lazyneſs, or for want of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be tempted to do miſchief to their Friends, reſolved to build Ships.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>M. Cato</hi> hath left upon Record, that ſome of his fellow-Soldiers were condemned to loſe their Hands for being taken ſtealing; and when a milder Puniſhment was impoſed, they were let bloud before the Generals Tent.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Clearthus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> General, was wont to ſay to his Army, That a Commander ought to be more fear'd than an Enemy. He meant by thoſe who were afraid to dye in the Battle; but if they run away, a certain Puniſhment and Execution was to be their reward.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Judgment of <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> was, that thoſe who had been taken by King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and were ſent home to the Senate, That the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be reduced to fight on Foot, the Footmen ſhould be degraded, and that all ſhould abide out of their Trenches untill each of them ſhould kill, and produce the Spoils of two men of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Otacilius Cruſſus</hi> the Conful, commanded thoſe who had been forced to paſs under the yoak, in ſign of ſubmiſſion, to continue out of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45285:82"/>the Camp and Works, that they having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, might be uſed to the Dangers, and be the bolder to encounter with the Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>P. Comelius Naſica</hi> and <hi>Decimus Junius</hi> the Conſuls, condemned ſuch to be publickly whipped with Rods, and to be ſold as Slaves, as had forſaken the Army.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>Domitius Corbulo</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> cauſed Two Troops of Horſe, and Three Companies of Foot who had given back in aſſaulting of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to continue, and lodge out of the Trenches, until by their continual Labour and happy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter they had wiped off their diſgrace.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Aurelius Cotta</hi> the Conſul, when out of neceſſity he commanded the Horſemen to labour in the Works, and that ſome of them refuſed to obey him, he complained of it to the Cenſors, and cauſed them to be puniſhed. And afterwards he obtained of the Senate that they ſhould loſe all their pay that was then due to them.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted them in this buſineſs, and by a general conſent this Diſcipline was eſtabliſht.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. <hi>Q. Metellus.</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Macedonicus,</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> commanded five Companies, who had been bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten back by the Enemy, to make their Wills, and ſent them back to recover the place, threatning them, that he would never receive them again till they had got the Victory.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>P. Valerius</hi> being Conſul, the Senate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Army that had been overcame at <hi>Siris,</hi> to be led to <hi>Firmius,</hi> and there to fortifie a Camp, and abide in Tents all the Winter.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. The Senate decreed when their Soldiers were ſhamefully put to flight, that no aſſiſtance ſhould be ſent to them, till they had beaten and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45285:83"/>taken the Enemy. Aud that thoſe Legions which had refuſed to fight in the <hi>Punick</hi> War, ſhould be tranſported over into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and there remain ſeven years, and live upon barley bread.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. <hi>L. Piſo</hi> condemned <hi>Titius</hi> the Captain of a Company, to ſtand every day bare-foot before his Tent when the Watch went the Rounds, with his Gown torn about him, and a looſe Caſſack, and that he ſhould abſtain from bathing and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, becauſe he had retreated back, and given ground to the Fugitives with whom he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. <hi>Sylla,</hi> when the Enemy broke in upon a Company, and the Commanders were upon the Guard, he ordered them to ſtand before the Generals Tent without Arms and Belts.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. <hi>Domitius Corbulo</hi> General in <hi>Armenia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Aemelius Rufus</hi> Leivtenant-General of the Horſe, to have his Garments broken and cut by a Sergeant, and in that ſhatter'd Habit to ſtand before the Generals Tent amongſt the <hi>Principes,</hi> until they were diſcharged, becauſe he had given back, and retreated from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and becauſe a party of his Horſe was but ill furniſhed with Arms.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. <hi>Attilius Regubus</hi> going out of <hi>Samnium</hi> into the Country of <hi>Nuceria</hi> with his Army, met with the Enemy that drove him back. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded therefore a Party of his Men behind to kill all ſuch as ſhould offer to retreat, and deal with them as with Fugitives.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. <hi>Cotta,</hi> Conſul in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> cauſed <hi>Valerius Nobilis</hi> a Collonel, deſcended of the Family <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria,</hi> to be puniſhed, by whipping him with Rods.</p>

                     <p n="31">31. The ſame <hi>Cotta</hi> condemned <hi>P.

                     <p n="32">32. <hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi> the Cenſor, put out of the Senate his own Brother <hi>Fulvius,</hi> becauſe he had, without the conſent of the Conſul, diſmiſt and ſent away a Legion, over which he was the Collonel.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. When <hi>M.

                     <p n="34">34. <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> was wont to take the Tenth Man of thoſe who did offer to give ground to an Enemy, by lot, and beat them with Clubs.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. <hi>Fabius Rollus</hi> the Conſul cauſed the lot to be caſt upon two Legions which had retreated from the Enemy, and thoſe upon whom the lot fell, to be beheaded in the preſence of the reſt of the Soldiers.</p>

                     <p n="36">36. <hi>Aquirius</hi> took the third man out of the Companies that had ſuffered their Guards to be faced by the Enemy, and cauſed them to loſe their Heads with an Ax.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Domitius Corbulo</hi> was wont to ſay that an Enemy was to be overcome with a Mattock, that is by Works and Trenches.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. It is reported of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> that when one told him that he was no Fighter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, My Mother made me a General, but no common Soldier.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>C.

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Q.

By this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſaid <hi>Sertorius,</hi> my Soldiers, I have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you the Nature of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, they are not to be overcome if you encounter

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Valerius Levinus</hi> the Conſul, having taken within his Camp a Spy of the Enemy, out of a confidence he had in his Soldiers, commanded him to be led about the Quarters; and to terrifie the Enemy, he aſſured him, that when they pleaſed, their Spies ſhould have liberty to take a View of his Forces.</p>

                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Cn.

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhewed to King <hi>Antiochus</hi> how he ſhould caſt Pots full of Vipers into their Enemies Ships, which ſo affrighted the Soldiers, that they were thereby hindred from reſiſting, and from the Government of their Ships.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Pruſias</hi> practiced the ſame Policy, when his Fleet gave back.</p>

                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> was wont to ſay, That it was good Policy, not only to give the Enemy a way to eſcape and fly, but alſo to ſecure it to them.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Pericles</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> promiſed his Enemies that they ſhould be ſafe, if they would caſt down their Weapons, which when they had done, he commanded all that had in their Armour Iron Bucklers to be ſlain.</p>

                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Alcetas</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> that he might more eaſily ſurprize a Convey of Victuals ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Thebes</hi> unexpected, provided ſome Ships in a ſecret place, ſhewing but one Galley, in which by turns, he exerciſed his Marriners. But in a convenient time, when the <hi>Thebans</hi> were ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by, he ſent out all his Ships againſt them, and took all their Proviſions.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> having but a weak Army when he marched againſt <hi>Perdicas,</hi> who was the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Forces, took all ſorts of Beaſts, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to draw behind them Carts, and to be driven forward by a few Horſemen. In the mean while he marched before with what Troops he had with him; ſo that the duſt raiſed by the Cattle gave an appearance of a vaſt Army that followed behind; which thought ſo terrified the Enemy, that they were put to flight.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Myronides</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> going againſt the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who were more numerous in Horſe, when his Foot came into the plain Fields, he told them, that if they did keep their grouod, they would be ſafe, but if they yielded, they would be deſtroyed, by this Speech he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his Soldiers, and got the Victory.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. <hi>L.

The next morning, in the Preſence of his Soldiers, he told the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates that he would deliver up the Keys, if all the Inhabitants deſired it, for that purpoſe all the Citizens being call'd into the Theater, demanded the delivery of the Keys. By this he underſtood of their purpoſe to revolt to the Enemy, he immediately therefore gave order to his Soldiers to fall on, and kill all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. <hi>Iphicrates</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> General took the Colours, at the appearance of the Enemies Fleet, and ſailed to a Town of which he had a jealouſie, and when at his landing he was received with great Expreſſions of joy, he found out their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, and plunder'd the Town.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> declared publickly that he would give liberty to all the Volunteers who behaved themſelves manfully, but that he would crucifie the Cowards. When therefore four thouſand of thoſe who had been ſloathful in the Fight, for fear of the Threatned Puniſhment, were gathered together on the Top of a Hill; he ſent to tell them, that his whole Army of Volunteers, in his judgment had got the Victory, ſeeing the Enemy was fled. By this ſaying he deliver'd them from the fear of Puniſhment, and kept them in their Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after the Battle at the Lake of <hi>Thraſginerus,</hi> where the <hi>Romans</hi> received ſo great a Loſs; when he had got into his Power ſix thouſand of his Enemies, by an agreement he ſent away all the Confederates of the <hi>Latine</hi>

                  <p>'TIS for your Peruſal that this Treatiſe is publiſh'd: To you I dedicate theſe Collections, as the moſt ſutable to your Generous and Martial Diſpoſitions. No Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under the Sun have taken a greater Delight in War than ours, and none have been more ſucceſsful in former Ages, and purchaſed more Honour in the Field than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But this is remarkable in Hiſtory, that their Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Victories were gotten more by their
<pb facs="tcp:45285:99"/>plain Valour, than by their Policies. The Strength of other Nations conſiſts in Subtilties and Ambuſhes; there are are few that dare face an aſſaulting Enemy in the open Field, and oppoſe their naked Breaſts to the Showrs of the Murthering Shot. Behend a Hedge, a Ditch, or a Breaſt-work, and when they have the Advantages of Number and the Ground, they may venture a Battel. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of for their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndaunted Courage in the midſt of the greateſt Difficulties, and have often ſnatcht the Victory out of the Hands of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Enemy. But if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Courage alone, without the Aſſiſtance of Art, hath been ſo Victorious, what Wonders would it not be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, if it were ſeconded by Policy and Craft? I conceive therefore it may not be uſeleſs to you, my Brave Countrymen, to have an Abſtract, or a Collection in your own Language of the
<pb facs="tcp:45285:99"/>Stratagems which have been practiced in War by the moſt experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; that when you may happen into the ſame Difficulties and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, you may underſtand what others have done to wind themſelves out, and by what means they have purchaſed Safety, Honour, and Victory to themſelves and Followers. I doubt not but ſome of you may have as ſharp and ſubtile Wits as good Courages, and that you will be able to uſe both in the buſineſs of War. But I believe none can deny, but a Collection of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as theſe, both Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, will be able to adviſe, direct, and encourage your Invention to inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Contrivances: For that purpoſe I have Tranſlated <hi>Frontinus,</hi> who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Roman</hi> Warriour, and of the Order of the Conſuls, Collected the moſt remarkable Stratagems of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Greeks, Romans</hi> and <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi> Their manner of Fighting
<pb facs="tcp:45285:100"/>and Weapons differ much from ours I confeſs; nevertheleſs we may learn from them, and be directed by them in many caſes; for we meet with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſubject to the ſame Paſſions and Infirmities as they, and we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſame Accidents and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities which happened to them. But for the compleating of this Treatiſe, I have added a Collection of the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Hiſtories of divers brave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits and cunning Stratagems, ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed by later Generals for the purchaſing of Victory, that you might have here a Proſpect of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Policies of the firſt and latter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges together, and that in the peruſal of the Noble Actions of our brave Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, you may ſee the ready, and path-way to Honour.</p>
                  <p>You know not how ſoon the Intereſt of the Kings Majeſty, and of this Kingdom, may call you, my Valiant Countrymen, into the Field. It is
<pb facs="tcp:45285:100"/>therefore your Wiſdom now amongſt the Delights of Peace, not to forget the difficulties and dangers of War, and to mind a judicious preparation for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as the Enjoyment of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. You eſpecially, are in reaſon to be ready for the Service of your Prince and Country, whoſe brave An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours have by their Valour purchaſed for you Titles of Honour and Eſtates together; You, who are to be Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Virtue and Courage, and who have the greateſt Intereſt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where you live. This Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to conſiſt not only in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Proviſions, in good Arms, and in the underſtanding the Duties and Arts of Officers and Soldiers; but if you be, or expect to become Leaders of Men, the Knowledge of the Warlike Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of former Captains, and how to enſnare an Enemy without hazard, will furniſh you with an excellent Skill for the Services that may be required from you.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45285:101"/>
                  <p>I ſhall only deſire that you would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Arts and Policies which you may learn from this Compendium for the Advancement of the Glory of your God, for the Preſervation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, Quiet and Happineſs of the Nation, for the Security and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our King, and for the Defence of the Intereſt of the Royal Family, which God of his Mercy Bleſs with all increaſe of Temporal and Spiritual Bleſſings.

After the firſt Battel, where the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers came off with Victory, <hi>Narſaeus</hi> cunningly retreats, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45285:102"/>the Province of <hi>Meſopotomia,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to make that the Seat of the War. When therefore he had gathered ſo great a power that he ſeem'd able to encounter the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſent a meſſenger to <hi>Ardaburius</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a parley, that they might appoint between them when and where to fight a Battel. <hi>Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burius</hi> wiſely anſwered the Embaſſadors thus: Tell <hi>Narſaeus</hi> from me, That the Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> uſe not to wage Battel at <hi>Narſaeus</hi> his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince had then all his Forces together, which exceeding the <hi>Romans</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cauſed the Citizens of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the whole Empire, to doubt of the ſucceſs and fortune of the War. But there happened one thing which much encouraged them and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fight valiantly. Certain Travellers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Bythinia</hi> towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> met, as they reported, with a company of Angels, who deſired them to ſalute and hearten the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in their names, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to pray to, and put their truſt in God, with this aſſurance, that they were ſent as Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Recruits and Auxiliaries to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army againſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and that they ſhould obtain a famous Victory. Whether this report was really ſo, or whether it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented on purpoſe, as it hath bin ſometimes practiced to encourage the Soldiers to difficult encounters, it had that good effect, that none doubted afterwards of ſucceſs; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers were more reſolute and brave in all their Fights with the Enemy. Inſomuch, that at the Siege of <hi>Niſibis,</hi> a panick fear ſo ſeized the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> who were came to relieve that City, and aſſiſt the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, that only the Alarm and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45285:102"/>Dread of the <hi>Romans</hi> approach, cauſed them in their Armour to caſt themſelves into the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and venture over; but the ſwiftneſs of the Stream ſwallowed an hundred thouſand, who for fear of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sword were drowned in the Water. In this <hi>Perſian</hi> War, <hi>Ardaburius</hi> by Policy alone, overcame ſeven great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Enemies. But notwithſtanding theſe glorious Victories, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſent one of his Courtiers named <hi>Helion,</hi> to conclude a Peace with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch; but this motion was at firſt rejected by the Soldiers of the Regiment called by the <hi>Perſians Immortal,</hi> conſiſting of 10000 variant Men, who deſired their Prince to give them leave to beat up the <hi>Roman</hi> Quarters, and try whether they might ſurpriſe them ſecure and negligent: But ſuch was the vigilancy and diligence of the Commanders, and courage of the Soldiers, that they encompaſſed theſe ſtout <hi>Perſians,</hi> and cut them all in pieces, though they had divided themſelves into two parties, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp with more advantage.</p>

                     <p>SEveral Generals were in the days of <hi>Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Leo.</hi> 1. <hi>Zeno Anaſtaſius,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> the former Emperours, but none much renowned for their Policies and Exploits. <hi>Beliſſarius</hi> was one of the moſt remarkable in all Hiſtory for his brave actions, and for the inſtability and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of humane Glory. His excellent conduct, together with his wonderful ſucceſs in War, raiſed him to the higheſt <hi>Apex</hi> of Honour: but envy, malice, and ingratitude, caſt him down to the loweſt ſtep of miſery, to beg his Bread at the Gates of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> the chief Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with this ſaying, <hi>Give a half penny to</hi> Beliſſarius. For the Emperour <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> cauſed his eyes to be put out, and all his Eſtate to be taken from him: after that he had by his Wiſdom and Valour ſaved and enlarged the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, and deliver'd the Emperors perſon from a ſtrong Conſpiracy, headed by one <hi>Floria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a Nobleman, and aſſiſted by <hi>Hippatius, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> and <hi>Probus,</hi> Kinſmen of the former Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Anaſtaſius.</hi> This act of Valour reſtored him to the Emperors favour, for he had bin in ſome diſgrace through the Envy of the Courtiers. He was of no extraordinary Birth, but raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf through his great skill in Martial Affairs. At that time <hi>Gilimerus</hi> Raigned over the Vandals in <hi>Africa,</hi> where that Northern People had erected
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45285:104"/>a flouriſhing Empire. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> proclaimed War againſt him, and ſent <hi>Beliſſarius</hi> as General, with a numerous Fleet; and well furniſhed Army. After ſeveral Encounters he met the <hi>Vandals</hi> in a pitcht Battel, overthrew and deſtroyed ſeveral Thouſands; purſued their King from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to another, till at laſt, he beſieged him, and took him by Famine in the City of <hi>Carthage.</hi> And with him, ſubdued all that part of <hi>Africa</hi> which had bin formerly under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power: and put a period to the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, which had infected all that part of the World. All this was brought to paſs, not ſo much through the Valour and Strength of the Army, as by the Policy and good Government of the noble Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who was excellent in laying of Ambuſhes, and in beſetting an Enemy in an open Field, whereby he was reduced to the neceſſity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of yielding, or of flying away. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Africa</hi> by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> happened about 95 years after the firſt entrance of the <hi>Vandals</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> according to the prediction of <hi>St. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who had ſo long before comforted his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with the aſſurance of a total extirpation of the cruel <hi>Vandals,</hi> together with their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſie. After this Victory, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> leads back his Army to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with <hi>Gelimerus</hi> bound in Chains of Silver. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was ſent next into <hi>Sicily,</hi> to revenge the murder of Queen <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſventa.</hi> He ſoon conquered that Iſland, and paſſed over into <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their King <hi>Theodatus,</hi> who was ſlain at <hi>Ravenna</hi> by his own People. In his ſtead they made <hi>Vitiges</hi> King. Againſt him <hi>Beliſarius</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, took <hi>Naples</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he defended againſt all the <hi>Gothick</hi> Power, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45285:104"/>by the <hi>Francs,</hi> and ſlew in one Sally under the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> in one day 30000 <hi>Goths.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſiege was raiſed, which laſted one whole year, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> relieved <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and forced the <hi>Goths</hi> to deſire the help of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and took their King <hi>Vitiges</hi> in the City of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> and carried him to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> From thence he went againſt <hi>Coſroes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and drove him out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories. But <hi>Totila</hi> the new King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> having made great progreſs in <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the abſence of <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and ſent thither again.

When the other was warring againſt the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Narſes</hi> was ſent to command in <hi>Italy</hi> againſt <hi>Totilas,</hi> the Valiant and Subtil King of the <hi>Goths.</hi> He made uſe of ſome of the <hi>Northern</hi> People, whom he called out of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45285:105"/>the <hi>Gothick</hi> Nation. There was a cruel Fight between him and <hi>Totila</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where the <hi>Goths</hi> were totally overthrown, their King kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Field. After this he recovered all the parts of <hi>Italy</hi> that had bin loſt from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and when the <hi>Francs</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Borders, <hi>Narſes</hi> ſet upon them unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, deſtroyed above 20000 of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd all the booty that they had gotten before. This <hi>Narſes</hi> was excellent in chuſing a fit time to aſſault an Enemy, and to give Battel; which made a Learned Hiſtorian, <hi>Procopius</hi> by name, to ſay, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came and appeared to him in his Prayers to God, to aſſure him of Succeſs, and adviſe him of the time when he ſhould give an on-ſet on the barbarous multitude. Certain it is, that outward Devotion hath ſeldom wanted Succeſs; and it hath been obſerved, that Hypocriſie and feigned ſhew of Piety have been often bleſſed with proſperous Events in War; whereas Impiety, though it may Triumph for a while, continues not long in its Flouriſhing Condition. So neceſſary it is that Men ſhould ſeek the aſſiſtance of Heaven in the critical time of War, and take the Directions and Helps of their God, to ſecond their natural Courage and Valour againſt their Carnal Enemies, as well as Spiritual. <hi>Narſes</hi> it ſeems is ſaid to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered as much by his Prayers as by his Sword. After <hi>Totilas</hi> was ſlain, the <hi>Goths</hi> gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under <hi>Teja</hi> their King; but <hi>Narſes</hi> encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred him near <hi>Cumae,</hi> overthrew, and utterly rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Empire in <hi>Italy,</hi> reſtoring it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion, from which it had been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken, and detained many years. <hi>Narſes</hi> after all theſe good Succeſſes, was employed in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45285:105"/>ſeveral Expeditions, wherein he failed not of the ſame Happineſs and Proſperity. But at laſt, though he had been ſo Victorious over all his Enemies abroad, he could not prevent the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and envy of his Enemies at home. <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> though an excellent Law-giver, could not give Laws to his Paſſions, and to his proud Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks and Family. The Empreſs <hi>Sophia</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Longinus</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> in his ſtead, with this opprobious Meſſage, That he ſhould come home to ſpin amongſt her Maids. He ſent her back this Anſwer, That he would ſpeedily Spin her ſuch a Thred, that neither ſhe, nor her Husband would be ever able to untwiſt. To make good this Threat, he ſends meſſengers to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> King of the <hi>Longobards,</hi> and invites him into <hi>Italy</hi> with his People. After this <hi>Narſes</hi> leaves <hi>Rome,</hi> and departed to <hi>Naples,</hi> where he dyed in a ſhort time after with Grief, as is ſuppos'd.</p>

                        <hi>COſroes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cabades,</hi> was a mortal Enemy againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> all his days. At his firſt Invaſion, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes</hi> were joint Generals together of the Emperors Army; and though <hi>Coſroes</hi> was both Wiſe and Valiant, at <hi>Niſibis</hi> and <hi>Daras</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45285:106"/>had the Victory, but becauſe they would not follow the good advice of <hi>Beliſarins,</hi> they were overthrown by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Auxiliaries, and forced to conclude a diſhonourable and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd Peace. For <hi>Coſroes,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilas,</hi> when he was hardly beſet by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> invaded again the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and would not be intreated by the Embaſſadours of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to deſiſt from his Enterprize. He took <hi>Surus,</hi> ſcituate upon the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> more by Policy than by Force: He reduced <hi>Beraea</hi> to Aſhes, deſtroyed <hi>Antioch</hi> with Fire and Sword; took <hi>Seleucia, Daphne</hi> and <hi>Apamia,</hi> and ſeveral other good Towns, becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was then employed at a diſtance off from thence in <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the <hi>Goths.</hi> So that he met with ſmall or no reſiſtance in this firſt Invaſion. Now there was a ſtrong report amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe days, that the City of <hi>Ediſſa,</hi> ſince the time that <hi>Agbarus</hi> had been King, who lived in our Saviours time, was impregnable, and that no Enemy could poſſibly take it, not ſo much through the ſtrength of the Walls, or any other natural Fortification, as through the Power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who had procured ſuch a priviledge to that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereof his Friend <hi>Agbarus</hi> had been King. <hi>Coſroes,</hi> to try the Truth of this Report, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a very great Army to beſiege <hi>Ediſſa.</hi> He ſat down before it, and raiſed a high Mount with Timber and Earth, which over-topped the Walls. The Citizens, ſorely gauled from this Mount with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Arrows, reſolved to ſet it on fire, by drawing in the Night a Ditch near to the Foot of the Mount, which they filled with combuſtible ſtuff; but when that ſucceeded not according to their expectation, and the Mount
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45285:106"/>could not take fire, they brought out the Picture of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was ſaid to be ſent to King <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barus</hi> from himſelf before his Crucifixion. That which before they could not effect, was then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd; for the Pile of Wood was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Flame, which the <hi>Ediſſeans</hi> encreaſed, by caſting in Tow, Brimſtone, Flaggons filled with Pitch and Tar. <hi>Coſroes</hi> to remedy this, opened the Conduits of Water to quench the Fire, but all in vain; the flame never ceaſed till the Mount was level'd with the ground. This Story is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Procopius</hi> and <hi>Evagrius, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. with other circumſtances. The latter Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian aſcribes the Miracle and deliverance of the City not to the Power of the Image, but to the Citizens Faith. However <hi>Coſroes</hi> roſe from his Siege, and departed with ſhame and diſhonour. Another ſtrange thing, the ſame <hi>Evagrius</hi> in the next Chapter reporteth, which happened to <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Sergiopolis.</hi> He fancyed the Walls of the Town to be furniſhed with Armed Men, ſhining in bright Armour, ready to defend them, when there were ſcarce any Perſons in the City. However, true it is that a panick fear cauſed him to leave that City alſo; and a Miracle was reported and believed in that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Age.</p>

                     <p>WHen as the <hi>Perſians</hi> continued in their Hoſtile Minds and Endeavours againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Juſtin</hi> the 2d. a Kinſman of <hi>Juſtinianus,</hi> though he were himſelf but a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and letcherous Prince, appointed a brave and noble Captain over his <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Army, named <hi>Martianus,</hi> whom he ſent with new raiſed Forces againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and to the Siege of <hi>Niſibis.

                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45285:107"/>to ſtop his Victorious Army, and revengeful Hands; for no great good can be expected from an Army when Generals want Experience, when Officers and Soldiers have no confidence in one another; when the chief Commander is look'd upon as a Coward, diſ-eſteem'd for his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Pride, Cruelty, or any other Imperfections of Body or mind. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was then in a ſad Condition, invaded by many Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations on all its Borders; ſo that the Empreſs, to remedy the Evils that threatned the State, perſwaded <hi>Juſtin</hi> to make <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a Valiant and Wiſe Man, Partner with him in the Empire. He immediately liſted a Stout and Numerous Army, and the Treaſure which formerly had bin converted to Debauchery, he employed to pay his Soldiers. Over them he appointed a diſcreet General, named <hi>Juſtinianus,</hi> and ſent him to give a Check to <hi>Coſroes,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> proceedings, who were then in <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia.</hi> The two Armies met; but when <hi>Coſroes</hi> was loath to venture the hazard of a Battel, becauſe of the Numbers and Stoutneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army: <hi>Curs,</hi> a <hi>Scythian</hi> Captain of the Right Wing of the <hi>Romans,</hi> gave ſuch a furious Charge upon the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that they were put to flight, and he purſued them to the place where the Kings Treaſure and Carriages were kept, which he brought away with him.

                     <p>THis General is repreſented to us a very Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and Politick Commander, free from Luſt and Debauchery, diligent and careful in his Buſineſs, watchful over the Enemy, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in all his Undertakings, ſteady and couragious in all his Reſolutions. He had great Succeſs in his Wars againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> for he took from them many Cities and Caſtles upon the Borders, and enriched the <hi>Roman</hi> Army with Spoils and Plunder. <hi>Famo Coſroes,</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> General, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by <hi>Adaarmanes,</hi> met him with their Forces, but they were both overthrown by the Wiſdom and Policy of <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and by the <hi>Romans</hi> Courage and Valour, when they were forſaken by ſome of their Auxiliary Troops: for ſuch a diſappointment, when an Army depends upon the aſſiſtance of others, who either run away, or fly to the Enemy to encreaſe their Power, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give great diſcouragement, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten the moſt Couragious Minds. Now when ſome Generals have had ſuch Jealouſie of any of their Forces, they have by Policy, or ſome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45285:108"/>cunning Invention, clapt a Plaiſter to the wound, wiſely prevented before the miſchiefs which ſuch Treachery or Cowardiſe would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bring upon the reſt of their Army: for a wiſe General muſt be furniſhed againſt all Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and be ready to meet an Encounter with all the un-expected Accidents which in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may poſſibly happen in a Battel. His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage alone is able to give life to his dying Army, and ſnatch from an Enemy the Honour of the Day. <hi>Mauritius</hi> was a Politick Commander, as may appear by a Stratagem, whereof he was the Author. When he was Emperour, <hi>Caganas</hi> King of the <hi>Avari,</hi> a <hi>Northern</hi> People, invaded the borders of <hi>Thracia,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many cruel Fights, beſieged <hi>Priſcus</hi> the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in a Caſtle. <hi>Mauritius</hi> not being able to raiſe the Siege, becauſe his Army was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employed, ſends a Letter to <hi>Priſcus</hi> to will him to hold out ſtoutly for ſome few days, for that his Fleet, which was now deſtroying the Country of <hi>Caganus</hi> with Fire and Sword, by his order would ſpeedily return and relieve him. <hi>Caganus</hi> intercepts this Letter as it was going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle; he believes the Contents to be true, therefore the fear of his own Territories made him in haſt to riſe from the Siege to ſave his Country from the ſuppoſed Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Caganus</hi> return'd again, and in ſix years time took and burnt about 40 good Towns of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> belonging to the Emperor <hi>Mauriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whoſe rare Virtues might have prevented theſe Miſchiefs, had not his neglect of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the baſe Vice of Covetouſneſs, a Vice unbecoming a Prince, procured him the hatred of his ſtouteſt Soldiers.</p>

                     <p>OF all the Impoſtors ſince the Creation of the World, none hath been ſo ſucceſsful as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and done more miſchief to the Humane Race. His damnable Superſtition hath bin aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with ſo much Policy, Intereſt and Power, amongſt rude and ignorant Nations, that the wonder of its great Succeſſes appears leſs to a Judicious Eye. <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Birth was but mean, but having the advantage of ſerving a Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, after his Deceaſe, he marryed his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and became ſuddenly very Wealthy. His Mother was a <hi>Jew,</hi> his Father a <hi>Saracen,</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but by Religion it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome, that he was an <hi>Heathen;</hi> his Name was <hi>Abdala.</hi> This ſubtile Impoſtor perceiving how ignorant the Men of his Country were of Religion, the general Debauchery that reign'd amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> their Feuds, Malice, and continual Quarrels, he took from thence an occaſion, and was thereby encouraged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim himſelf a Prophet, and to ſet up a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of his own. The Myſteries of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Religion he could not well reliſh, he was therefore oppoſed, and called in queſtion for his dangerous and helliſh Opinions at his firſt appearance at <hi>Medina,</hi> and forced to fly, and hide himſelf in a Cave, where <hi>Secgius</hi> a <hi>Weſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45285:109"/>Monk aſſiſted him to compoſe the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> the rule of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> Faith and Religion, which is politickly and ſubtilely made up of ſuch Precepts and Doctrines as are moſt pleaſing to the Viciouſneſs and Corruptions of Men, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the Inhabitants of thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. To his Followers he allows all things grateful to their Appetites, and gives large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of future advantages, but ſuch as reject his Doctrines, he threatned with Fire and Sword, and order'd his Diſciples to deſtroy and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are commonly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry modeſt in their behaviours, and ſeemingly devout, and abſtain from the moſt ſcandalous Sins which diſgrace too much the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. <hi>Mahomet</hi> had not long proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Prophet before he was choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Army that had aſſiſted <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelius</hi> the Emperor againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Upon the denyal of their juſt Wages, they fell upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces to pay themſelves with the Spoils of the Country. <hi>Mahomet</hi> could not have a better opportunity to ſettle his Religion; for by his Wit and Succeſſes he wanted not thoſe of his Country that ſided with him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Gain, and help'd him to propagate his Faith with the ſharpneſs of their Swords. He had great proſperity in all his Wars, and when he was dead, <hi>Abubecher</hi> his Kinſman ſucceeded him, and within two Years took ſeveral Towns from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Next to him was <hi>Omer,</hi> and after him <hi>Ottoman.</hi> They all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſecure their Intereſt amongſt the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant People by the ſame divelliſh Arts, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriſie, and Counterfeits. For <hi>Mahomet</hi> had a Pidgeon that would come to his Ear, which he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45285:110"/>declar'd to be a Divine Meſſage ſent to direct and adviſe him. When he was troubled with the Falling Sickneſs, he invented, that then the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> did appear to him, and caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Divine Rapture, whereby his Senſes were ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified. Theſe three formal Succeſſors of <hi>Mahomet</hi> reformed the <hi>Alcoron,</hi> and blotted out a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groſs Abſurdities which were there before; and left all their Conqueſts and Honours to <hi>Mortis Aly,</hi> who could not be contented with the Honour of ſucceeding <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but reſolved to ſet up for himſelf, declaring that he was a greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet than <hi>Mahomet</hi> had bin. Their wonderful Succeſs in War, and the great progreſs that they made in a few years, cauſed the ignorant World to believe that theſe wicked Impoſtors were more than ordinary Men. <hi>Homar</hi> took in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> and all <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> with <hi>Aegypt; Hally</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſpread his impious Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all over the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries. He was ſlain by <hi>Muavias,</hi> who enlarged his Dominions as far as the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Sea, conquered <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and in a notable Sea-Fight beat the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Navy, and kill'd ſo many <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the Sea was dyed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Bloud. Such terrible executions, together with the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Armies, and their ſubtile way of Fighting, more by ſurprize and Ambuſh, than by plain Valour, ſtruck ſuch a terrour to all the Provinces of the Empire, that as ſoon as they appeared, the Inhabitants would compound with the <hi>Arabian</hi> Leaders to ſave their Lives, and yield unto them what ever elſe they would require. This wonderful ſucceſs made them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture into <hi>Italy, Greece, Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and to run over all the Sea-Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> where
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45285:110"/>their Poſterity continues to this very day. Theſe <hi>Mahometans</hi> are bound, to propagate their Religion, and generally believe that if they kill, or are killed by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the quarrel of their falſe Prophet, they are undoubtedly ſaved, and their Souls admitted into Paradiſe. This Error cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to be ſo Couragious in the greateſt Dangers; and the plunder of the Countries invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great many Vagabonds to joyn themſelves in hopes of Gain, to that Damnable Superſtition, and to their numerous Armies. They conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Sicilia, Sardinia,</hi> and almoſt all the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Iſlands of the <hi>Mediteranean</hi> Sea, and beſieged the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the IV. in his Imperial City. But their great Navy was ſet on Fire by an Invention of <hi>Callinicus,</hi> a Learned Methematician of thoſe days, who with Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls that would burn in the Water, deſtroyed all their Ships, with 30000 men in them. By this means the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces were quiet for a while, and deliver'd from the fear of their Cruel Neighbours, till they encreaſed again, and under the leading of <hi>Abdimelech</hi> their King. He recovered and conquer'd <hi>Perſia, Meſopotamia, Armenia, Hircania,</hi> and ſeveral other large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, with the Deſtruction of <hi>Muſtar</hi> and <hi>Said,</hi> his two Potent Enemies. Thus through the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Cowardiſe of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People, through the Diviſions amongſt <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> the Cruelty, Diligence, Policy and Power of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> and his Succeſſors, prevailed in a wonderful manner.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Saracen</hi> Armies were in thoſe days not only in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> but in <hi>Europe</hi> alſo, they conquered all the plain Countries of <hi>Spain,</hi> and erected ſeveral Kingdoms there. At the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of <hi>Eudon</hi> Duke of <hi>Guien,</hi> jealous of the Greatneſs of <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> they entred <hi>France,</hi> and paſſed over the <hi>Pyrenian</hi> Mountains, under the command of <hi>Abdiran</hi> their General. <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> they took, with ſeveral other great Towns that were forced to ſubmit to their vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for they were above 300000 men with all their Families. <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi> Chief Maſter of the Kings Palace, taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Name of Prince of <hi>France,</hi> encountred theſe Foreign Enemies with an Army of <hi>French, Germans</hi> and <hi>Longobards,</hi> and to oblige his men to ſtand to the Fight with more Courage, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced behind them certain Troops of Horſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to kill all ſuch as ſhould offer to fly away. This ſevere courſe obliged them to be ſo couragious and reſolved, that they cut in pieces, as is recorded in Hiſtory, near 370000 <hi>Saracens,</hi> with little loſs on the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> part. This Famous Victory, together with the wonderful deliverance of the <hi>French</hi> Countries from the danger of theſe Infidels, made <hi>Martel</hi> to be both beloved and highly honoured by all that Nation, ſo that he had no great difficult to ſet aſide the Race of the former Kings, and to make way for his Son <hi>Pipin</hi> to aſcend upon the <hi>French</hi> Throne inſtead of <hi>Chiperick,</hi> who was ſhut up in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45285:111"/>a Monaſtery. This hath often bin the unhappy Fate of ſuch Princes as have minded more their Pleaſures than the Government of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and have left to others that charge which they are, by God's appointment, to take upon themſelves. <hi>Martel,</hi> after the Slaughter of the <hi>Saracen</hi> Army in the Fields of <hi>Aquitania,</hi> met with two Generals more of the ſame Nation, upon the Borders of <hi>Navarre, Athimus</hi> and <hi>Amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> who brought with them a great Company of the ſame People. He ſlew <hi>Eudon,</hi> the wicked Duke of <hi>Aquitania,</hi> and drove all the <hi>Saracens</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> and encouraged <hi>Pelagius</hi> an Earls Son, to endeavour to free the Kingdom of <hi>Gallicia</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> from thoſe troubleſome Gueſts. With a very ſmall Company this <hi>Pelagius</hi> deſtroyed vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and was for his good Service and Valour ſaluted the firſt King of <hi>Gallicia. Pipin</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles Martel</hi> ſucceeds his Father in the Government of <hi>France,</hi> and in his ambitious deſigns; for he confined his Lord and King to to a Covent, and took from him his <hi>Regalia,</hi> with the Popes approbation: when <hi>Pipin</hi> ſent to him to know who was fitteſt to Reign, a Stupid prince, or an Active Subject; the Pope under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his meaning, gave orders to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> to ſet the Crown of <hi>France</hi> on <hi>Pipins</hi> Head. Thus the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſecured their Intereſt and Authority by obliging Perſons of the greateſt Valour, Activity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that they might help to enlarge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Dominions. For <hi>Pipin</hi> having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo great a Courteſie from <hi>Pope Stephen,</hi> he could do no leſs than aſſiſt him with an Army when he was overpowred by <hi>Aiſtulphus</hi> King of the <hi>Longobards,</hi> from whom he took <hi>Ravenna,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45285:112"/>Bononia, Imola, Faventia, Ferrara, &amp;c.</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them as a Gift on the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And when <hi>Aiſtulphus</hi> beſieged <hi>Rome</hi> with an Army at <hi>Pipins</hi> return into <hi>France,</hi> the Pope was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to implore again his Aid, which he eaſily granted, and forced <hi>Aiſtulphus</hi> to purchaſe his Peace with the yielding of the third part of his Treaſures, and a yearly Tribute, which he paid to the <hi>French.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Pipin</hi> at his return out of <hi>Italy</hi> with his Army, conquer'd <hi>Aquitania</hi> and <hi>Goſcony. Pipin</hi> was a Politick Prince, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope and Clergy in thoſe days were in high eſteem, he did them all the reverence, ſhewed them all the favour that was in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and they to requite his kindneſs, raiſed him from the condition of a Subject to that of a Monarch. When Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> came to implore his Aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Longobards,</hi> he met him with his Wife, Children and Nobles, three Miles out of his City, and received him with a knee upon the ground, took the Reins of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Bridle, and led him to his Pallace, whilſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the People ſung Songs to the Praiſe, and in honour of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the new King. For it concerned him and his Poſterity to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and extol that Authority, by which he was eſtabliſhed in the Throne, and his lawful Prince thruſt out. Therefore both he and his Son <hi>Charles</hi> did always magnifie the Popes Power, Credit and Dominion, and would never ſuffer them to be queſtioned by any other earthly Judges. <hi>Pipin</hi> ſounded the Biſhopwricks of <hi>Saltsburg, Ratisbone, Aihſtrat</hi> and <hi>Friſinge</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and was very bountiful to other places. He was the firſt who brought in the uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans into the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45285:112"/>one as a preſent from the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And 'tis obſerved of him, that he was ſincerely Zealous, and Religious in his perſwaſion. He endeavour'd to propagate the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and to employ that Power that God gave him, to advance his Glory. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Heatheniſm, Judaiſm, and all manner of Hereſies, and eſtabliſhed a civil Government for the execution of Juſtice. The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> was firſt appointed by him, not to give a check to the Royal Authority, but that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> might adviſe with the moſt ingenious and excellent Men of his Kingdom, who were well acquainted with the conditions and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People; that all Reſolutions and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Acts might be made for the common good, and the preſervation of the Grandure and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Monarchy. This King highly promoted alſo all thoſe who had bin active to eſtabliſh him upon the Throne, and was very careful not to ſuffer Virtue in the meaneſt perſon to go unrewarded.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45285:113"/>likely to be robbed of all St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony by <hi>Deſiderius,</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards.</hi> With a ſtrong Army he marches into <hi>Italy,</hi> and in a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fight overcame <hi>Deſiderius,</hi> and beſieges him in <hi>Ticinum,</hi> took him with the Town, and ſent him and his Wife into <hi>France.</hi> All <hi>Italy</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Victorious Banners of <hi>Charles,</hi> who enlarged the Dominions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. To the former gift of King <hi>Pipin,</hi> he added ſeveral large and rich Towns. At his return into <hi>France,</hi> he undertook an expedition againſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who were Heathens, and with them he overcame the <hi>Weſtphalians,</hi> the <hi>Huns,</hi> the <hi>Angarians,</hi> the <hi>Heſtians,</hi> but the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> kept him in play 33 years before they could be totally ſubdued. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> to relieve them; he marched with his Army into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had wonderful Succeſs; but at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn over the <hi>Pyrenian</hi> Mountains, the paſſages were ſo beſet by the Country People, that he loſt his Army, and was forced to fly for his Life, leaving <hi>Eginbardus, Roland, Anſhelmus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his beſt Officers, dead behind him. <hi>Adal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſus</hi> and <hi>Thaſtilo,</hi> the Son and Nephew of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderius,</hi> raiſed ſome ſtirs in <hi>Italy</hi> to recover <hi>Lombardy,</hi> but them he overcame by his Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; the firſt he put to Death, and confin'd the ſecond to a Monaſtery. After all theſe Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Succeſſes, <hi>Charles</hi> deſerved well the name of <hi>Great;</hi> and to requite his kindneſs to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man See, Pope Leo</hi> the 3d. put upon him the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown, and made him the firſt Emperour of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> upon <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day, in the year 800.

                     <p>This <hi>Charles</hi> was a very Wiſe, Learned, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and Fortunate Prince; for he ſubdued the greateſt part of <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Saxony, Pannonia, Hiſtria, Ducia, Liburnia</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> He was very liberal to the Churches and Clergy of his days. 23 Metropolitan Churches inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited his Treaſures, beſides, he built many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſes and Colledges, and appointed the 12 Peers of <hi>France,</hi> Six of the Clergy, and Six of the Laity. And it is reported of him, that at Supper time he would have ſome Godly and Religious Book to be read to him. So careful he was for the preſervation of the right Faith in his Kingdoms, that when <hi>Neſtorianiſm</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Corruption and Wickedneſs of two Biſhops, he called together at <hi>Franckford</hi> a Synod of 300 Biſhops to judge and determine that Controverſie. Therefore for his care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the regard he had in all his Actions to God's Glory, he was bleſſed with wonderful Succeſs in all his wars, ſo that his Fame was ſpread all about the known World; and he was courted by the remoteſt Princes, by the <hi>Greeks, Saracens, Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The Emperour not imagining the Subtilty of <hi>Telerichus,</hi> named thoſe very Men to be Commiſſioners, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed all their Princes deſigns and plots to him. <hi>Telerichus,</hi> as ſoon as he knew them, put them all to death, and puniſhed them for their Treaſon.</p>

                     <p>THere was a great ſtir in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire about the Images of the Church.

As ſoon as they had yielded up their Arms, which they did the more willingly, becauſe they thought that they ſhould be employed againſt the Common Enemy, ſhe baniſhed them out of the City, and took away their Goods and Eſtates.</p>

At his arrival, he found the Emperours Army the ſtrongeſt, and ready to give Battel. To prevent the miſchief that was like to fall upon the Sons, whom he ſecretly favoured, and whom he had ſtirred up againſt their Father, he went over to the Emperours Army, as if he had intended to reconcile the Father and the Sons together; but as it appeard afterwards, it was to get ſome time, that the Emperours Army might be prevailed with by his cunning Followers to forſake their Lord, and to join with, the Young Men. This Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was carryed on ſo ſubtilely and ſecretly by rewards and promiſes, and by ſowing the Seeds of diſcontent in the Army, that when they were drawn out to Fight, they went over to the Sons Army, and forſook the poor Aged Emperour, who was then forced to caſt himſelf in the hands of his wicked and rebellious Sons, who ſhut him up in Priſon.

At laſt, when <hi>Arnulphus</hi> deſpaired to take it by force, and was going to raiſe his Siege, it happened that a Hare ran before his Army towards the breach. The Soldiers gave immediately a great ſhout and hollow, running after the Hare. The Guards upon the Walls thinking they were coming to give an aſſault to the City, in a panick Fear ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted away, and forſook their ſtations and charge, which as the Soldiers of <hi>Arnulphus</hi> perceived, they entred the Town, and took the City. Thus was <hi>Rome</hi> once ſurprized by the guidance of a Hare. Such caſual accidents have oft-times

This obliged the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Perſia, Mahomet,</hi> to ſend againſt them a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army, which by the skill of <hi>Tangrolipiae</hi> was defeated. <hi>Mahomet</hi> inraged at this loſs, puts out the eyes of Ten of the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and threatens to apparel all the reſt of the flying Army in the Garb of Women, and to carry them about his Kingdom as Cowards. Theſe threatnings could not be diſgeſted by thoſe Military Souls, whoſe miſhap, not want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, had loſt the day againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> They therefore, either out of Fear or Revenge, went all away to <hi>Tangrolipix,</hi> to encreaſe the number of his Army. When <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> was thus ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this unexpected Recruit, he kept not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any longer in the Deſarts and Mountains, but marched with a compleat Army to meet with <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the Fields of <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> where after a bloudy Fight, <hi>Mahomet</hi> fell from his Horſe, and broke his neck. At his death both Armies ſounded a Retreat, and their Chieftains came to a Parley, where it was agreed, that <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> ſhould be ſaluted Sultan of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This was the firſt Kingdom of the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hiſtory, after the leaving of their own Country. <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> conquered <hi>Babylon,</hi> and warred againſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with various ſucceſs: and at laſt he conquered many rich Provinces of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45285:118"/>Empire, partly through the covetouſneſs of <hi>Conſtantine Ducas,</hi> then Emperour, who taxed all the Borderers, and ſuffered them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Garriſon from the ſtrongeſt places of the Country, whereas before they were free, for the ſervices they rendred to the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and partly for want of encouraging and entertaining military men. By theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples a Prince may learn, that it is no point of policy to provoke men of courage by too great ſeverity; nor to ſuffer his Armies and Captains to want that due regard which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and deſerve, when his Dominions are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and endanger'd by powerful and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemies. By the contempt and neglect of Arms the <hi>Greeks</hi> have loſt their Honour and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and are forced to ſubmit to the <hi>Turks</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppreſſion, and are now become the baſeſt of Men in War.</p>

                     <p>O <hi>Thoman</hi>'s wonderful Proſperity purchaſed to him the hatred and envy of many of his Neighbours; ſo that ſeveral <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captains of ſmall Caſtles living round about him, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their Aſſembly to murder <hi>Othoman;</hi> and the better to effect their wicked purpoſe, they deſigned to invite him to a great Marriage, which was to be ſolemnized between the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Belizuga</hi> Caſtle, and a fair <hi>Lady,</hi> the Daughter of the Captain of <hi>Jar-Chiſer.</hi> This Captain of <hi>Belizuga</hi> had the management of the Plot left to him. He ſent therefore for one <hi>Michael Coſſi,</hi> a neighbour Captain, and an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend of <hi>Othoman,</hi> to prevail with him at the day appointed to be preſent at the Marriage, for then in the midſt of their mirth and jollity, it was reſolved to kill <hi>Othoman. Coſſi,</hi> when he underſtood it, reveals the whole deſign to <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who deſired him on his part to conceal the Diſcovery from his Enemies, but to tell the Captain of <hi>Bilezuga</hi> that he would not fail to wait on him, and that he thought himſelf much obliged to him for many former Favours, for protecting his Cattle and Subjects, deſiring him to continue his good Offices, more particularly in this time of War, which he had undertaken againſt one <hi>Germeanogli,</hi> of whom he ſtood in ſome fear. Therefore he entreated him that he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45285:119"/>would receive into his Caſtle certain things of greai value, which he would ſend thither to be ſecured better than in any other parts of the Country: and to tell him alſo, that he intended to bring his Mother and Wife to be acquainted with his Lady. When <hi>Coſſi</hi> had deliver'd this meſſage to the Captain, he rejoiced greatly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that his Plot would take effect, willing <hi>Coſſi</hi> to tell <hi>Othoman</hi> that he ſhould be welcom, with all ſuch Gueſts as he ſhould pleaſe to bring. When the Marriage-day approached, <hi>Othoman,</hi> as his cuſtom was to pack up his Goods, and ſend them to <hi>Bilezuga,</hi> inſtead of Rich Houſhold-ſtuff, he filled his Packs with Armed Men, and caſt over them ſome homely Coverings, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Young Men to follow the Carriages in the garb of Women, as if they had been his Wife, and Mother-in-law, with their Servants and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants: All this Train he cauſed ſo to march, that they ſhould come to the Caſtle at the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day. The Captain was then in the Fields, providing for the Solemnity of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the next day, which was to be kept at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place about Three miles from the Caſtle. <hi>Othoman</hi> goeth to meet the Captain; after many Complements, and feigned expreſſions of Love, <hi>Othoman</hi> intreats him that his Women might have liberty to enter into his Caſtle, and retire themſelves into ſome convenient place, which was readily granted. But when theſe diſguiſed Girls were entred, they played the parts of Men; for being aſſiſted by thoſe who leaped out of the packs, they ſlew the Guards, and took the Caſtle. The Captain having notice of this ſurprize from ſome that fled out, made haſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Othoman</hi> with his Followers, but he was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45285:120"/>ſo briskly entertain'd, that he was there ſlain, with many of his men. <hi>Othoman</hi> purſues his good fortune, and the ſame night takes the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Jar-Chiſar,</hi> with the Captain and his Daughter <hi>Lulufer,</hi> with all their Company ready for the Marriage. Thus he ſubtilely turn'd the plot that was intended for his Deſtruction, to the ruine of his Enemies. After this, <hi>Othoman</hi> took <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Bythinia, Neapolis, Pruſia;</hi> and in the year 1300. took upon him the Title and Honours of a Sultan, meeting with little oppoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>Michael Paleologus,</hi> then Emperour of the Eaſt, was buſie with his own Subjects, who would not yield to that change which he was reſolved to bring into the Religion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for he had promis'd the Pope to conform to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Both Clergy and People were averſe to thoſe Alterations; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to force them, employed all his Soldiers when he ſhould have ſent them againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy; who in few years got ſuch footing, and by the mildneſs and eaſineſs of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government, made many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to prefer a living under them, rather than under ſuch a cruel and barbarous Emperour.

There they lay expecting the Dukes coming, who in great contempt of theſe Vagabonds, aſſaulted them as ſoon as they could come to them. But when his Horſes began to ride over the ploughed ground, which was then over-grown with Graſs, they began to ſtick faſt in the Mire: ſome caſt off their Riders, others were not to be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and they were moſt rendred unſerviceable by this means; ſo that the <hi>Catalonians</hi> ſhot them with their Arrows at their pleaſure, without

                        <hi>ORthanes</hi> treading the Footſteps of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Father, proceeded by policy in moſt of his expeditions. There was at the death of his Father a certain ſtrong Caſtle named <hi>Tzuprichiſer,</hi> ſituate upon the paſſage of the River <hi>Sangarius,</hi> which ſtopt all the inrodes of the <hi>Turks</hi> into part of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and was a great ſuccour to the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> lately recovered from the <hi>Turks</hi> by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captains. This Caſtle poſſeſſed by the <hi>Chriſtians, Orthanes</hi> endeavour'd to recover; for that purpoſe he diſguiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his followers in the Habit of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Merchants, with their Weapons concealed about them, and nothing viſible but Packs, and ſuch Wares as were uſually carryed that way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Neighbouring Villages. At the Gates of the Caſtle he deſires the Guard that he, and his might have liberty to enter in, and paſs through. They without any ſcruple ſuffered him to go in, thinking that they had bin Merchants indeed; but as ſoon as they were within the Gates, they fell upon the Guards, overcame them, and took from them this ſtrong Caſtle, which gave them an inlet to all the moſt pleaſant Country about <hi>Nice.</hi> So that the Subjects of the Emperor were continually vexed by their unreaſonable plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and forced for their ſecurity to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45285:123"/>under their protection. By this means he got daily ground, and encroached ſtill upon the Borders of the Empire. <hi>Andronicus</hi> the younger, to ſtop the progreſs of the <hi>Turks,</hi> liſted an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and met them in the Field near <hi>Philocrene,</hi> a Town in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> where he was defeated and wounded, and for want of good order, his whole Army forced to fly, leaving behind him all his bag and baggage. After this good ſucceſs, <hi>Orthanes</hi> commanding all the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City of <hi>Nice</hi> without any oppoſition, reduced it to great want of Proviſions, ſo that when the Inhabitants complained to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he promiſed to ſend them 1000 Horſe to keep Garriſon there, and defend them from the <hi>Turks</hi> power. <hi>Orthanes</hi> had intelligence of this promiſe, and of the coming of this Cavalry: to prevent them, he reſolves to take <hi>Nice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their coming, which he readily performed by this Stratagem. He cauſed about 800 of his ſtouteſt men to take the Habit and Furniture which <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Horſemen uſed then to wear, commanding them to take a compaſs about, and ride directly to the City, in that way that leads from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Nice.</hi> At the ſame time he ſent about 300 of his own Horſemen in their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Apparrel to ſpoil the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in view of the City. At that very inſtant the 800 Horſemen in the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Garb came Travelling towards <hi>Nice,</hi> and ſeeing the others plundring the Country, they fell upon them, and overcame them in a Fight, which was all done in ſight of the Citizens of <hi>Nice.</hi> After the ſuppoſed Victory, they rid to the Gates with ſome part of the Spoils of their counterfeit Enemies. The Citizens thinking that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45285:123"/>Succours were come, opened to them their Gates with Joy, and without much examination. But as ſoon as they were within, the <hi>Turks</hi> made them feel the ſharpneſs of their Swords; and theſe 800. with 300 more that fled out of ſight, and a ſtrong Ambuſh that lay near the City, joined all together, took and plundred it, and left it to be poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks</hi> to this day. After this, and the gaining of all the Sea-ports about the ancient and demoliſhed City of <hi>Troy, Accecoza,</hi> a Captain of <hi>Orthanes,</hi> beſieged <hi>Abydus,</hi> a Famous Caſtle upon the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> which he took by the Treachery of the Captains Daughter in the Caſtle. She had ſeen in a Dream a certain Officer Cavalier, of a very handſome Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, who helped her out of a Miery Ditch, and performed ſeveral other pleaſing Services to her. The Image of this Gallant was ſo fixed in her mind, when awakened, that ſhe longed to ſee the reality of the Man that was ſhewn to her in her ſleep. It happened that when the Caſtle was beſieged by the <hi>Turks,</hi> an Officer did uſually ride up and down near to the Walls. She looked out at a Window and ſaw him, and found that this was the Man whom ſhe had already in her Fancy and Affection; therefore ſhe provided a Letter for him, which ſhe caſt over the Wall at his next riding about, tyed to a ſtone. <hi>Abdurach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was the name of the Cavalier. He takes it up, and ſhews it to <hi>Accecoza</hi> his chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who there finds that the Amorous Virgin promiſed to betray to them the Caſtle, if they would raiſe the Siege; and if <hi>Abdurachman</hi> would return to the Caſtle Walls, with ſome few Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and obſerve her Directions.

                     <p>AS ſoon as <hi>Amurath</hi> came to ſucceed in his Fathers Kingdom, he concluded a Peace with the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motichum</hi> taking advantage of this time of Peace, reſolved to fortifie his City, and for the better carrying on of his Work with ſpeed, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the Maſons, Carpenters and Workmen he could poſſibly get When <hi>Amurath</hi> underſtood his purpoſe, he ſecretly cauſed two hundred luſty Workmen to come over out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and to offer their ſervice to the Governour. He, tho' he had been forewarned by ſome to take heed of the <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Workmen, hired them, but appointed to them their Lodgings out of the Walls every night. When <hi>Amurath</hi> had intelligence of all particulars, he ſent <hi>Chaſis-Ilbeg</hi> with thirty other ſtout Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to deſire work of the Governour, and ſerve as Labourers, to carry Stones and Mortar. The Governour truſting too much to the Faith of the Faithleſs <hi>Turks</hi> in that time of Peace, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them awhile. At laſt <hi>Chaſis</hi> ſteals away to <hi>Amurath,</hi> gives him an account of all paſſages, and tells him that if he had any more help, he would endeavour to ſurprize one of the Gates of the City, to let in a greater number, if they were at hand. <hi>Amurath</hi> ordered all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſire, and ſent him back to <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motichum</hi> to put his device in execution. <hi>Chaſis</hi>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:45285:125"/>at his return, watches an opportunity. When the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were at dinner, then did he cauſe the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Workmen and Labourers to counterfeit a Brawl, and to fall from Words to Blows; whilſt they were thus quarrelling, one party of them ran ſuddenly to one of the Gates of the City, where they took hold of the Weapons of the Guard, as if it had been to defend themſelves from their purſuing Companions; but they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them againſt the Soldiers keeping Guard, and being aſſiſted by a party of <hi>Turks,</hi> who waited near the Town for that purpoſe, they overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Citizens, and took <hi>Didimotichum,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Rhodeſtum,</hi> by aſſaulting the Walls of the latter in the night. The <hi>Turks</hi> generally have had great ſucceſs by employing ſuch ſubtile Plots againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and taking them at an advantage. The ſame <hi>Amurath</hi> took the City of <hi>Adrianopolis</hi> by policy. He ſent <hi>Chaſir-Ilbeg,</hi> one of his great Captains, and perſwaded him to run away with ſome other truſty Fugitives to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and to complain and exclaim againſt the cruelty and hard uſage of their Lord <hi>Amurath.</hi> This <hi>Chaſis-Ilbeg</hi> with his <hi>Turks,</hi> in ſeveral Sallies, behaved himſelf right valiantly againſt the Soldiers of <hi>Amurath,</hi> which purchaſed him a great Eſteem, Favour and confidence with the Governour, who truſting too much, whilſt they were at a ſecret appointment with their Lord, when they ſhould betray one of the Gates to him. For <hi>Chaſis,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cuſtom, came once at break of day only with ten Followers, as if he had bin going out to hunt; when the Gates were opened, he aſſaulted the Soldiers that were upon the Guard, and having at hand all his Fugitive <hi>Turks,</hi> they took poſſeſſion of the Gates, which they kept till
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45285:125"/>ſuch as were ſent from <hi>Amurath</hi> came to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; then they fiercely charged the Citizens. The Fight continued from Morning till Night, but the <hi>Tarks</hi> at laſt by their continual Recruits, got the Victory, and with it the Noble and Rich City of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the <hi>Othoman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors have ſince kept a <hi>Seraglio.</hi> At this time lived in <hi>Amuraths</hi> Court, <hi>Cara Ruſtemes,</hi> a Doctor of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law. He perſwaded his Lord to take every fifth Captive of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Youth, of about 12 or 15 years old from his Soldiers, when they returned from the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Countries. Theſe Youths were ſent over into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to be bred up in the Houſes of the Country Farmers, and employed in hard Labour for two or three years, that they might be inſtructed in that time in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion and Language. After this, they were ſent for, and trained up in the exerciſe of Arms, that they might ſerve the great <hi>Turk</hi> in his Wars, and wait upon his Perſon, as his Foot Guard, Theſe were named <hi>Janizaries,</hi> that is, new Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who had thence their firſt beginning. As the <hi>Mamalucks</hi> alſo in <hi>Aegypt</hi> had their original from Captivity and Bondage; for they were Slaves brought thither by Merchants into <hi>Scitia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, and ſold to the <hi>Sultans</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to be brought up in the Art of War. Theſe, as the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are now to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperours, were the beſt Soldiers of the Prince, and their Stouteſt Men in War. <hi>Amurath</hi> enlarged his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> He invaded <hi>Servia,</hi> took <hi>Appolonia,</hi> and many great Cities, conquered <hi>Caramania,</hi> and in a notable Battel kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Deſpot of <hi>Servia;</hi> but it happened after the Fight, when <hi>Amurath</hi> was taking a view

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45285:128"/>March, before they could be provided, they were both beſieged in the City by the Enemies, who ſpoiled all the Country round about. <hi>Huniades</hi> and the Biſhop ſallies out upon them, but were forced by an Ambuſh to retreat. The Biſhop was ſlain, but <hi>Huniades</hi> ſaving himſelf, went all about his Government, and gathered what Power he could make up, perſwading the People to venture themſelves in the juſt Defence of their Country and Families. With this Tumultuary Army he marches after the Baſſa, then proud with Succeſs, and laden with Spoils. And for the better carrying on of his purpoſe, he ſent Spies to give him notice of the <hi>Turks</hi> Motions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. From them he underſtood that <hi>Meſites</hi> had given a ſpecial command to all his Officers and Soldiers to aſſault the Perſon of <hi>Huniades,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Valour and Direction depended the Fortune of the day. In the Army of <hi>Huniades</hi> was one <hi>Simon Kemene,</hi> an adventurous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who knowing of the <hi>Turks</hi> deſign and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, offered to change Horſe and Armour with his General for his greater ſafety; which when <hi>Huniades</hi> had granted, he purſued the <hi>Turks,</hi> and skirmiſhed with them every day; at laſt they came to a Battel, where the counterfeit <hi>Huniades,</hi> ding his Generals Horſe, was beſet by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and after a ſtout reſiſtance, ſlain. But the true <hi>Huniades</hi> in the mean while incouraging his Men, receiving ſuch as were oppreſſed, rallying ſuch as fled, made a great ſlaughter of the Infidels, in whoſe Camp were many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Priſoners that broke their Chains, and with ſuch Weapons as came next to hand, charged the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Rear, whilſt <hi>Huniades</hi> kept them in play, till they were forced to fly. <hi>Meſites,</hi> with his Son, was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45285:129"/>ſlain, and 20000 <hi>Turks.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt about 3000 Men, but recovered all the Plunder, Spoils and Priſoners. After this notable Victory, he laid the Foundation, and made a preparation far greater, firſt by returning thanks to the God of Hoſts, the Giver of all Succeſs, and cauſing Solemn Thankſgiving to be made in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his Government; next, by acknowledging the Soldiers Valour and Courage, and giving to every one, both Officers and others, their due Praiſes; by enriching his Army with the Spoils of his Enemies, which he converted not to his own private uſe, but made them plentifully ſhare in the enjoyment of that which they had got with the hazard of their Lives; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating to Pious Uſes ſome part of the Spoils, that he might thereby return Thanks to God both in Word and Deed. Never any covetous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was ever ſucceſsful in War. As the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Soldier muſt do the Work, he muſt not want that encouragement which Military Souls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. The beſt, as well as the meaneſt, are moſt willing to venture their Lives with thoſe, by whoſe Bounty and Liberalities they have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably obliged. And if Soldiers will be careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their God, upon whoſe pleaſure the Lives of Men, and the hazards of War do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately depend, he will undoubtedly mind them in their greateſt diſtreſs and dangers. To defie God and his Power by filthy Oaths and Blaſphemies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our Fore-Fathers, is now the common practiſe of thoſe, who would ſeem to be the ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Men. This is a baſeneſs and madneſs which <hi>Atheiſme</hi> hath much encouraged; and which can never draw upon their Heads (who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to ſuch extravagant Liberties) a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45285:129"/>but rather a Curſe. And thoſe Armies, where ſuch bold Follies are either countenanced or winked at, can never proſper long. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Conquerors and moſt ſucceſsful Warriors, both in former and latter Ages, have bin care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to encourage Religion, and to take with them the Bleſſing of Heaven in all their notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; and after a proſperous proceeding, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto God his Praiſes due, by a publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his Power and Bounty. <hi>Huni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> is an example of true Valour, which hath always Piety joined with it.</p>
                     <p>After this Victory <hi>Valachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Turks.</hi> To revenge himſelf, <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> raiſed a very great Army, and ſent it under the command of <hi>Schech-Aheden-Baſſa,</hi> who paſſing through <hi>Valachia,</hi> deſtroyed all their Country with Fire and Sword, and entred into <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> with an intent to do the like there. But <hi>Huniades</hi> met him with 15000 choſen Men, at a place called <hi>Vaſcape,</hi> where he drew up ſome Battalions in form of a Wedge, which did him great ſervice, and could not be broken by the <hi>Turks</hi> Violent Aſſaults: ſo that after near five hours continual fight (during which time the Fields were covered with an incredible number of dead Bodies) the <hi>Turks</hi> fled; and the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> kill'd above one half of the Infidels, recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 190 Enſigns, and all the Bag and Baggage of the Enemy.

                     <p>NExt to <hi>Huniades,</hi> none deſerves more to be mentioned than the Noble <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> Prince of <hi>Egyrus.</hi> In his youthful days he lived in the <hi>Turks</hi> Court of <hi>Amurath</hi> then King, and for his dexterity in Arms, was highly favoured by the Tyrant, who had poyſoned his elder Brethren, and taken away the Inheritance of his Fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. At the Battel of <hi>Moravia,</hi> where <hi>Caram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> was taken, he was a Commander amongſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> In the general Rout he cloſely followed aſter the Generals chief Secretary, till he found him in a place fit for his purpoſe, which he had imparted to ſome of his moſt truſty Friends and Countrymen, chiefly to <hi>Ameſa</hi> his Kinſman, a ſtout Soldier. They all together agreed to ſet upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they found them few in number, and to kill them. The Secretary he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed aſide, and forced him for fear of preſent Death, to write a Letter in his Maſters Name, who (was Grand Vizir) to the Governour of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45285:132"/>
                        <hi>Croia,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Epirus,</hi> to command him by <hi>Amuraths</hi> order, to deliver, on ſight of the Letter, his Charge and Government to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> the new Governour, as appointed by <hi>Amurath</hi> to ſucceed him, adding ſeveral other things, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to gain more credit to the Letter and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers. As ſoon as he had thus forced from the Secretary this Letter, he killed him, and as many of the <hi>Turks</hi> as he could meet with, that they might not give intelligence of his Deſigns and Proceedings to Old <hi>Amurath.</hi> And having with him under his Command three thouſand <hi>Epirots</hi> his Countrymen, who reſolved to follow his Fortune, and fight for the Honour and Liberty of their Native Country. He marched with all ſpeed towards <hi>Epirus;</hi> and to the chief City of <hi>Croia.</hi> He ordered the moſt part of his Soldiers to go in the night, and by ſecret ways through the Woods and Mountains, to draw as near to <hi>Croia</hi> as they could unperceived, until he had an opportunity to bring them into the City to maſter the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Garriſon. In the mean while he took with him a few, only to wait upon him, and went the direct way to <hi>Croia,</hi> ſending before him <hi>Ameſa</hi> with two Servants, to certifie the Governour of his coming. <hi>Ameſa</hi> behaved himſelf with that Wiſdom and Diſcretion, that the Governour could not perceive any deceit, much leſs when he ſaw the great Baſſa's Letter, written by his Secretary, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered up the command of the Town, and departed the next day for <hi>Adrianople.</hi> The ſame Night <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> brought into the City his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were appointed to be near at hand: with their aſſiſtance he ſet upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſlew them. The recovery of <hi>Croia</hi> cauſed all <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to yield to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and the Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45285:132"/>with great joy gave him their aſſiſtance, to kill all the <hi>Turks</hi> that were left in his Dominions; the Governour alſo of <hi>Croia</hi> was overtaken by the <hi>Epirots,</hi> and murthered with his Retinue. Only ſome ſtrong places and Garriſons were not ſo eaſie to be maſtered; but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having called his Subjects to his Aſſiſtance, he in few days gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together 12000 Men, with whom he beſieged and took <hi>Petrelta,</hi> a ſtrong City, by the ſubtile Tale of a Country Fellow, ſent thither on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> to tell the Garriſon, that <hi>Amurath</hi> had been lately ſo defeated by the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> that he could not relieve them, and that they might have any Honourable Terms granted, if they would ſubmit to <hi>Scandberbeg.</hi> After this he took poſſeſſion of <hi>Petra Alba, Stelluſa,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Srifegrade,</hi> but could not recover that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: therefore riſing from that Siege, he waſted all the Borders of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and ſpoiled the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round. <hi>Alis Baſſa</hi> was ſent with an Army of forty thouſand to puniſh him, and recover <hi>Epirus. Scanderbeg,</hi> to defend himſelf, choſe 8000 Horſe, and 7000 Foot, and with this ſmall Army he waited upon the Borders near <hi>Dibra,</hi> for the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's coming; but he had placed three thouſand Men with <hi>Ameſa</hi> in Ambuſh in a Wood, near the great Road where the Baſſa was to paſs with his Army, commanding them not to ſtir until ſuch time as they ſhould ſee that the Fight was begun, and that then they ſhould fall upon the Rear of the <hi>Turks.</hi> This order was ſo exactly obeyed, that the <hi>Turks</hi> having the Enemy before and behind, were beſet by a ſmall number; yet they did fight valiantly, until a freſh ſupply from the Rear came and broke in upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to fly, killing in the purſuit and Battel
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45285:133"/>two and twenty thouſand, and two thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoners, with all the <hi>Turks</hi> Tents and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. After this great <hi>Slaughter, Scanderbeg</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Footmen upon the <hi>Turks</hi> Horſes, and with all his Army he plundred miſerably a great part of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and enriched his Soldiers. This great Victory made <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Name to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous all over the Courts of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, ſo that in a general Confederacy between them for the oppoſing of <hi>Amurath, Scanderbeg</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to be one of the party; for that purpoſe he raiſed an Army, and intended to aſſiſt <hi>

Theſe Footmen ſet upon the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalry in ſuch places where they could not uſe their Horſes, that they were all routed and ſlain, and purſued by two thouſand Horſe, which <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> had there for the purpoſe. <hi>Feriſes</hi> ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Flight with his broken Troops. When <hi>Amurath</hi> heard of this Overthrow, he ſent one <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> another Captain, with a Recruit of 6000 Horſe to ſucceed <hi>Feriſes</hi> in his Government, with orders to burn and ſpoil as much of <hi>Epirus</hi> as he could. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> a wary Captain, came with his Troops into the Valley of <hi>Moerea,</hi> where he lay ſtrongly encamped in his Trenches every night, having placed Scouts and Sentinels all round upon the Hills, to diſcover the Enemies coming; with 4000 Horſemen he kept his Camp,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45285:133"/>and ſent out the reſt in parties to ſpoil the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with expreſs orders, upon pain of death, to repair to him upon the firſt notice of an Enemy. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being informed by his Spies of <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha's</hi> warineſs, reſolves to deal with him by plain Force; therefore with 4000 Horſe, and a 1000 Foot he ſpeedily marched through the Valley to the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, where he kill'd many that were retreating with their plunder, and then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the Trenches with that Fury and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were beaten, 5000 were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and 300 taken Priſoners, with the loſs only of twenty Horſemen, and fifty Foot. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> fled with the reſt of his Forces to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to give an account of <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs</hi> Valour, and of his own loſs to Old <hi>Amurath,</hi> who reſolved to ſuffer awhile this dreadful Enemy to live in Peace; therefore he commanded <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> not to moleſt the Borders of <hi>Epirus,</hi> but only to defend his own Government. It happened at that time that there was a Quarrel between <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and an open War pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed: When <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſaw that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s Forces were employed againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he begg'd leave of <hi>Amurath</hi> to try once more his Fortune againſt <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> For that purpoſe with a numerous Army he entred into <hi>Epirus,</hi> when <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was beſieging the Town of <hi>Dayna,</hi> where he left ſome Forces with <hi>Ameſa</hi> to continue the Siege, and with 500 Horſe, and 1500 Foot he went to find out <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> encamped in the upper Country of <hi>Dibra.</hi> Out of the Garriſons he recruited and encreaſed his ſmall number to 4000 Horſe, and 2000 Foot, all old Soldiers. When both Armies were drawn up in Battalia, a <hi>Turk,</hi> advantagiouſly mounted, came out of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45285:134"/>
                        <hi>Turks</hi> Army to challenge any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to fight with him: his name was <hi>Caraguſa.</hi> One <hi>Paul Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſi</hi> deſired <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> that he might be the Man to encounter with this <hi>Turk,</hi> which being granted, at the firſt blow he wounded him grievouſly in the Head, and cut it off, which when he had done, he took his Spoils, and return'd with great Acclamations of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who ſeeing how much this had encouraged his Men, ſet forward againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and with an invincible Courage beat them out of the Field, took <hi>Muſtapha</hi> Priſoner, killed 12000 Men, whereas of his own Army there was but 300 ſlain. The Plunder of the Enemies Camp he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beſtowed upon his Soldiers, who met there with great Riches, and according to his Cuſtom, entred again into the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions to plunder and burn the Country. <hi>Amurath</hi> grieved at ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſſes, reſolves, with a mighty Army, to march into <hi>Epirus</hi> himſelf, and try his own Fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this crafty Warriour. <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of his coming, made all things ready: he craved Aid of all his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Neighbours; filled his Towns with Food, Proviſion and Arms, repaired all the decayed Fortifications, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered an Army of 10000 Men to attend upon him, leaving ſufficient Garriſons in every City. <hi>Amurath</hi> had in his Army one hundred and fifty thouſand Men. He ſent forty thouſand before him to <hi>Stifegrade,</hi> to make preparation for his coming. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> marched thither with 4000 Horſemen, a thouſand Foot, and ſtrongly encamped himſelf within Seven Miles of the City: from his Camp he went up with ſome of his Captains to the top of a Hill as near as he could, to ſee how the <hi>Turks</hi> lay before <hi>Stifegrade;</hi> at his return he drew
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45285:134"/>out his ſmall Army, and placed them in the Woods not far from the City, unto which he ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Muſachi,</hi> with about 30 Horſemen, to drive ſome Horſes loaden with Corn, as if they had purpoſed ſecretly to get into the City. When the <hi>Turks</hi> Scouts perceived them, they charged them, but were beaten back, with the loſs of five men, which gave the Alarm to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who marched out to purſue them, in number about 4000. <hi>Moſes</hi> politickly drew them away from their Camp to the place where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> lay in Ambuſh. He roſe with his Men, ſet upon them with that Fury, that he killed 2000. and took a thouſand Horſe, with the loſs of two and twenty of his own Men. <hi>Amurath</hi> came before <hi>Stifegrade</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> 1449. he battered and aſſaulted the Town with the ſlaughter of vaſt numbers of his beſt Men; during which time <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> often brake into one part or other of his Camp, making a terrible deſtruction, and then again retreated with little or no loſs. At one time, when <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> was giving an aſſault to the City; <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was diſcovered drawing near to the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, and, by <hi>Amuraths</hi> order, was met with by <hi>Feri-Baſſa,</hi> who long deſiring to fight with <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> was by him ſlain, and his Army routed, with great loſs: but becauſe all the <hi>Turks</hi> Army were at hand, he ſpeedily retreated from thence with his Victorious Army. <hi>Stifegrade</hi> was afterwards betrayed and ſurrendred: but <hi>Amurath</hi> loſt before the City 30000 of his beſt Men. At his departure <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> followed, and cut off many of his Army aſſaulting him ſometimes in the Rear, ſometime, in the Van, as place and occaſion would ſuffes him. The next Spring <hi>Amurath</hi> returned intr <hi>Epirus</hi> with an of Army 160000 Men, ſeading beo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45285:135"/>fore <hi>Sebali,</hi> as a wiſe Captain, with 40000 Horſe to beleagure the City of <hi>Croia.</hi> After a furious Battery, it was aſſaulted by the <hi>Turks;</hi> but <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contes</hi> the Governour ſo encouraged his Soldiers and Citizens, that they ſtoutly defended it: whilſt they were then buſie in the aſſault, <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> with 5000. broke into their Camp, killed 500 Men, and was ſpoiling of their Tents: This gave an Alarm to the whole Army, ſo that the <hi>Baſſa Seremet</hi> and Prince <hi>Mahomet</hi> with his Guard haſted to reſcue their Camp, and to deliver it from ſuch troubleſome Gueſts. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in his Retreat being incloſed in by the <hi>Turks,</hi> broke through ſeveral Bodies of them ſafe, but with great danger of his Life. During this Siege he had ſtrongly encamped himſelf upon the Mountain <hi>Tumeniſt,</hi> not far from the <hi>Turks,</hi> that he might be more ready to plague his Enemies, and aſſiſt his Subjects beſieged in <hi>Croia. Mahomet,</hi> to prevent <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> for the future, had drawn all the beſt Soldiers of his Army on that ſide where he was wont to aſſault them; but he having good Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, cauſed an Alarm to be given by <hi>Moſes</hi> there, whilſt he, in the mean while, with a ſtrong party of 8000 Men at Midnight entred their Camp at the farther end, and made a very great flaughter of the <hi>Turks. Amurath,</hi> after many cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Aſſaults given to the City, and furious Attempts to no purpoſe, through the Vigilancy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and Courage of the Defendants, dyed for Grief under the Walls of <hi>Croia.</hi> His Death cauſed the Siege to be raiſed by his Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whoſe Army was followed, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably cut off by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in their return home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, at all places of advantage. But to keep him in continual Play, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſent one <hi>Ameſa</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:45285:135"/>a <hi>Turk,</hi> with 12000 Horſemen to waſt <hi>Epirus. Scanderbeg</hi> laid for him an Ambuſh upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Modriſſa,</hi> where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s Infantry fell upon thoſe Horſemen, and killed 7000 men, with the loſs of the <hi>Turks</hi> General taken Priſoner, who was afterwards ranſom'd at 13000 Duckats by <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The Money was diſtributed amongſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soldiers. After this, one <hi>Debreas</hi> a Valiant Captain, requeſted <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be ſent againſt <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who hearing of his coming, went to meet him in the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions with 6000 choice men. <hi>Debreas</hi> had 14000. <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> thought to have come upon him unawares, but he was prevented and diſcovered, therefore the two Armies drew up, and after a ſharp engagement, <hi>Scanderberbeg</hi> ſlew <hi>Debreas</hi> with his own Hands, as he was riding about to encourage his Men. The whole Army, at the loſs of their General, fled, and left behind them 4120. ſlain by the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Mahomet</hi> endeavour'd next to corrupt ſome great Man of <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Army; <hi>Moſes Golemus</hi> of <hi>Dibra</hi> was the perſon pitched upon. He fled to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and returned with an Army of 15000 men into <hi>Epirus,</hi> where he was encountred by his late Prince, and 11000 of his Soldiers killed, with the loſs of one hundred <hi>Epirots.</hi> In this Battel <hi>Ahemaze,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> challenged <hi>Zacharias Groppa</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and was by him killed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed before the Fight. <hi>Moſes,</hi> at his return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was ſo derided by the <hi>Turks,</hi> that he preferr'd to caſt himſelf upon the mercy of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who received him again, and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, reſtoring to him all his Goods, which had been confiſcated. <hi>Turks</hi> won next <hi>Ameſa,</hi> a Nephew of <hi>Scanderbegs,</hi> promiſing him the Crown of <hi>Epirus.</hi> With him <hi>Iſaak</hi> the Great Baſſa was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45285:136"/>ſent with 50000 men, to proclaim him King of <hi>Epirus. Scanderbeg</hi> had provided a good Army, but came in ſight of the Enemy only with 6000 Horſe, with whom he took the way of <hi>Lyſſa,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as if he had deſpaired of keeping of <hi>Epirus</hi> any longer, and had fled thither for the ſafety of his Perſon. The <hi>Turks</hi> rejoiced, as if they had no Enemy to deal with, or to fear. When <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſaw the <hi>Turks</hi> ſecure, and that they had the day before ranged about the Country for Plunder and Spoil, he divided his ſmall Army into three Parties, and came upon them before they expected him, for they had not time to bridle their Horſes. <hi>Ameſa,</hi> making Head firſt, was taken Priſoner, and his Party defeated. The Baſſa was overthrown by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Tanuſius,</hi> two of <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Captains, and driven out of <hi>Epirus.</hi> He loſt about 20000 men, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> but 60. All the Bag and Baggage, and Tents of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were there taken, with great Riches, by the <hi>Epirots.</hi> Three years after <hi>Sinam</hi> and <hi>Hamur,</hi> two other Captains, were ordered by <hi>Mahomet</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the quiet of <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Kingdom; but <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> with 20000 men, was overthrown, and his Succeſſor <hi>Aſambeg,</hi> with 30000. was defeated next in the Plains of <hi>Ocrida,</hi> himſelf wounded and taken Priſoner by <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> One <hi>Juſſembeg,</hi> with 18000. entring into <hi>Epirus,</hi> loſt part of his Army, and was glad to ſave himſelf by flight with the reſt. Their misfortune cauſed one <hi>Caraza-beg,</hi> an old Companion of <hi>Scanderbegs,</hi> to requeſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> to venture an Army with him: He truſted him with 40000 men; but when <hi>Carazabeg</hi> had near 4000 Horſe, who were cut in pieces by an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh at his firſt entrance into <hi>Epirus,</hi> and been wearyed out with continual Alarms by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:45285:136"/>in the Night, the weather proving very Tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and full of Rain, he returned back to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> with leſs loſs than any before him. A Peace afterwards was concluded between <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> but it laſted not long, becauſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries received on both ſides. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to defend his Territories bordering upon <hi>Epirus,</hi> ſent <hi>Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Baſſa</hi> with fourteen thouſand Soldiers, but he was routed in the Plains of <hi>Ocrida,</hi> and 10000 <hi>Turks</hi> ſlain. <hi>Balabanus Badera,</hi> an <hi>Epirot</hi> born, was the next great Captain, who invaded <hi>Epirus</hi> with 15000 Horſe, and 3000 Foot. He ſought to ingratiate himſelf with <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> by Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Gifts; but becauſe he was born a Peaſant, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſent him a Shovel, a Mattock, and a Flail. This <hi>Balabanus</hi> was three times overthrown in Battel by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and his Armies routed and cut in pieces. At his return he perſwaded <hi>Mahomet</hi> to ſend two Generals with 40000 men againſt <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> ſo that he, and one <hi>Jacub Amauth</hi> entred into <hi>Epirus. Balabanus</hi> was firſt defeated, and forced to fly, with great ſlaughter. <hi>Jacub</hi> next was killed by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himſelf, and his Army diſperſed. <hi>Mahomet</hi> went into <hi>Epirus</hi> next, and ſent <hi>Balabanus</hi> with 80000 men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Croia</hi> before him, but was perſwaded to return back <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and leave the command of the Siege to <hi>Balahanus,</hi> who riding up to the Gates of <hi>Croia,</hi> to offer them Honourable conditions, was ſhot in the Throat, and dyed in his Camp. The Army fled, after the death of their General, out of <hi>Epirus,</hi> leaving behind them their Tents and Carriages. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> the next Spring retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a vaſt Army to the Siege of <hi>Crota;</hi> but when neither by Rewards nor Strength he could prevail upon the Governour nor Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45285:137"/>and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> vexing him every night with conſtant Alarms, by aſſaulting and cutting off great numbers of his Men, he departed with his Army to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for fear of other Miſhaps. Theſe Adventures of the Noble <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> are almoſt incredible; but they are affirmed and recorded to Poſterity by <hi>Marinus Barletius,</hi> a Grave Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.

                     <p>THis Town of <hi>Gunza</hi> was but ſmall and weak, but ſtoutly defended by <hi>Nicholas Jureſchits</hi> the Governour, againſt <hi>Solymans</hi> vaſt Army. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the great Baſſa had a particular kindneſs for this <hi>Nicholas,</hi> becauſe he knew him to be a brave Soldier, and had been intiamtely acquainted with him when he was Embaſſadour at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> As a Token therefore of his kindneſs, he ſent him a Meſſenger at his arrival, to wiſh him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Town, with large promiſes and threatnings: but when he ſaw nothing would work upon the couragious Governour, he cauſed the Town to be undermined, and the Walls to be blown up in three places; after this he gave ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral furious Aſſaults, but was ſtill beaten back by the Defendants: and to trouble them the more, the Baſſa had placed a Battery on the North-ſide of the Town upon a high Hill, from whence he did kill the Beſieged as they were ſtanding to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend their Breaches. But the Governour raiſed ſpeedily a Curtain behind his Soldiers to keep off the <hi>Turks</hi> Shot. After this two great Mounts were caſt up with Earth and Faggots, and the Town Ditch level'd, to facilitate their next Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults; but the <hi>Turks</hi> were again ſeveral times driven back with great loſs and ſhame. At laſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45285:139"/>the Soldiers within being for the moſt part either wounded or killed, the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſet up eight Enſigns upon the Walls, and the beſieged began to ſhrink away, when ſuddenly the Women and Children in the Town gave a very great ſhout and cry, which ſo diſmayed the <hi>Turks,</hi> who thought that the Town had been yet full of Soldiers, that they began to look back, and retreat apace. At this ſight the Governour and Soldiers took Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and charged them ſo furiouſly, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Walls, and could not be perſwaded, nor threatned, by their Leaders to another Aſſault. When the Great <hi>Turk</hi> ſaw the numbers of his men ſlain, and that his Army had given no leſs than thirteen Aſſaults, with great loſs and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in his rage he threatned not to leave a ſtone ſtanding in the Town. But <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Baſſa, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſave the Governour, when <hi>Solymans</hi> anger was over, perſwaded him not to diſhonour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any longer about ſuch an inconſiderable Town, telling him, that there was no man but would think him able to take and deſtroy ſuch a ſmall place in time, but that it were more Wiſdom to preſerve his Soldiers for greater deſigns, and to depart from before this mean Village: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would call the Governour to him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, that out of his generoſity and love that he did bear to men of Valour, he would give him the Town, and all that was therein. When <hi>Solyman</hi> had ſuffered himſelf to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Governour was ſent for, and Hoſtages deliver'd into the Town inſtead of him. The Baſſa diſcourſed with him, and asked him, why he would offer to reſiſt his Great Maſters Power, when every one elſe yielded, and depend upon the relief of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> not likely to come
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45285:140"/>to his Aſſiſtance. The Governour anſwered, that he had done nothing but what became a Man of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and that for his part, he knew King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would aſſiſt him as ſoon as he could, but that his chief dependance was upon his God, who would not be wanting to his Endeavours. The Baſſa in concluſion told him, that <hi>Solyman</hi> might eaſily deſtroy him and his Town, but that he was ſo courteous, and ſo great a ſavourer of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Men, that for his ſake the Town ſhould be ſpared, but that he muſt receive into the Town a Captain and ten <hi>Janizaries</hi> in ſign of ſubmiſſion.

                     <p>THis Prince was one of the Nobleſt and moſt Fortunate Generals of our late years. When the <hi>Turks,</hi> his unquiet neighbours, together with the <hi>Tartars</hi> invaded his Dominions: he ſet upon them, and made a great ſlaughter of them. He recovered <hi>Valachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> from the <hi>Turks,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the two Princes of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <hi>Sinan</hi> was ſent with a vaſt Army into <hi>Valachia,</hi> where the Prince met him, and in a great Battel, which laſted from morning till night, overthrew the <hi>Turks</hi> Army with a wonderful ſlaughter. <hi>Sinan</hi> fled, and left all his Tents and Great Guns, with Rich Spoils, to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army. To revenge this great Loſs, <hi>Sinan Baſſa</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> chief Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, raiſed 70000 men to drive the Prince out of <hi>Valachia.</hi> He came to <hi>Tergoviſta,</hi> where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped with his Army, but at the report of the Princes coming, the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſo terrified, that they fled, and <hi>Sinan</hi> himſelf dreaded a ſecond Encounter with ſo ſucceſsful and valiant a General, who purſued him from place to place as far as <hi>Tergoviſta,</hi> where the Prince cut in pieces 4000 <hi>Turks,</hi> who had bin plundring the Country, and recovered 60000 Head of Cattle, which they had taken out of <hi>Valachia.</hi> The Caſtle of <hi>Tergoviſta,</hi> which was ſecured by <hi>Sinan</hi> with a Guard of 4000 <hi>Turks,</hi> commanded by <hi>Haſſan Baſſa,</hi> was taken, and all the Soldiers put to the Sword.

This Prince blaſted the Glory of <hi>Sinan Baſſa,</hi> which he had many years gotten by his skill in War, and recovered three fruitful Provinces from the <hi>Turks, Tranſilvania, Valachia,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia:</hi> a greater loſs they never received at one time by Land.</p>

                        <hi>MAhomet</hi> the 3d. was grievouſly troubled by his Rebellious Subjects in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who had got together in ſuch conſiderable numbers, and had ſuch brave Generals to command them, that all his Forces were not able to ſubdue them. They overcame and cut in pieces ſeveral of his beſt Captains. At laſt he was adviſed to circumvent them, and by fair means to draw them into his Service, and into ſuch places as he might take them off at his pleaſure. <hi>Zellaly</hi> was one of the moſt conſiderable; to him he cauſed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

At the ſame time one <hi>Gordon</hi> lay in Ambuſh, and defeated <hi>Thomas Muſgrave,</hi> Governour of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and his Troops, and took him Priſoner. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> entred <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> again under the Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> with fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but in their return, only 500 Horſe in the Night aſſaulted and overthrew them, becauſe they imagined them to be a greater number. King <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>England</hi> invaded <hi>Scotland</hi> with 60000 men, and a great Fleet; but King <hi>Robert,</hi> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring and ſpoiling <hi>England,</hi> diſperſed this great Tempeſt without much loſs to his own Kingdom. In this Kings time the <hi>Scots</hi> took part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> and had many notable Victories over the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> ſo that after he had governed his Kingdom, and defended it againſt all Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he left it to his eldeſt Son <hi>John,</hi> who was perſwaded by his Parliament to change his name into the fortunate name of <hi>Robert;</hi> he had two Sons, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Robert,</hi> the firſt was created Duke of <hi>Rothſay;</hi> the ſecond, Duke of <hi>Albany. David</hi> incurr'd his Fathers diſpleaſure by his youthful pranks, and was confin'd to the keeping and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45285:148"/>of his younger Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> who made him a cloſe Priſoner, and reſolved to ſtarve him to death; but a Country Maid found means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Life for a while with thin Oat Cakes, which ſhe gave him through a Window; and a certain Nurſe cauſed him to ſuck her Breaſts at a diſtance, by a long Cane. To King <hi>Robert</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his youngeſt Son <hi>James,</hi> after a long Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in <hi>England.</hi> He deliver'd his Kingdom from many inteſtine Enemies. <hi>Alexander,</hi> Lord of the Iſles, was by him ſubdued; and all the little Tyrants that plundred and robbed his People. He commiſſioned ſeveral Judges to make a Circuit about his Kingdom, and to hear the Complaints of his Subjects. He was as great a Lover of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as of Juſtice, and as careful to promote the publick good, by inviting many skilful Perſons in Manufactures. His reputation was ſo great, that he was earneſtly courted by the Embaſſadours of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to joyn with them in League and Affinity: but at laſt he was ſo unhappy, that a Conſpiracy being made againſt him, he was baſely murthered at <hi>Perth</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> and his wicked Aſſociates, who within forty days after were deſervedly tortured to death. The Earl was Crowned with a burning Crown of <hi>Iron,</hi> his Joynts diſlocated by the Strapado, the next day he was drawn through the ſtreets of <hi>Edinburg</hi> upon a hurdle, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for High Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>To King <hi>James</hi> the I. ſucceeded his Son <hi>James</hi> the II. yet a Minor, <hi>Anno</hi> 1537 The Regency of the King and Kingdom was committed to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Leviſton.</hi> The Queen, a ſubtile Woman, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtempers of the Kingdom encreaſe through the imperiouſneſs and ill government of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45285:148"/>
                        <hi>Chrichton,</hi> reſolved to get the King out of his Cuſtody by this Invention. She obtained leave to lodge with her Son in <hi>Edinburg</hi> Caſtle: at laſt ſhe found a means to convey him out of the Caſtle to <hi>Leith</hi> in her Trunk, where her Linen was uſed to be kept. This King, when he came to be of Age, obtained a notable Victory over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at a place called <hi>Sarc,</hi> and killed 3000 of his Enemies, with the loſs of 600 <hi>Scots.</hi> The Earl <hi>Douglaſs</hi> was then too Potent for the King and Kingdom, and too haughty for a Subject. The King therefore weakens that powerful Family, brought them upon their knees, after many ſierce Skirmiſhes and Battels; and ſuch as continued in their Rebellion, he baniſhed out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. At laſt he raiſed an Army to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi> againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. of <hi>England.</hi> After this Kings overthrow, the Lords ſent to King <hi>James</hi> to deſire him to disband his Army, and not to moleſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Borders, threarning him, that if he did otherwiſe, they would meet him in the Field. He anſwered the Meſſengers, That he was reſolved to take the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Roxburg,</hi> which he had beſieged; and that he was not to be driven away from thence by Words. As King <hi>James</hi> was ſtorming the Caſtle of <hi>Roxburg,</hi> he gave fire to one of the great Guns himſelf, and was ſuddenly ſtruck dead. The Queen, then in the Army, deſired the Lords not to be dejected by the Kings death, nor to forſake the Siege; and told them, that ſhe would provide another King for them; her Son <hi>James,</hi> then about nine years old, who was brought into the Camp, and ſaluted King by the Army, who never left off till they had taken the Caſtle, and demoliſhed it. Thus this Couragious Queen, undaunted at the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45285:149"/>death of her Husband, continued in the Field to hearten the Soldiers, and force the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſurrender this ſtrong Caſtle to the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>King <hi>James</hi> the III. ſucceeding to his Father, wanted not his Courage, though he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be too much govern'd by his paſſions, which brought him at laſt to an untimely end. To him ſucceeded <hi>James</hi> the IV. who in the year 1500 proclaimed a War againſt <hi>England,</hi> in favour of the <hi>French,</hi> and ſent a great Fleet to their Aſſiſtance. He was ſo reſolved, that when he was diſſwaded from a Battel with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe of his ſmall and weak number, he declared to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> he would fight them, if they were one hundred thouſand ſtrong. The <hi>Scots,</hi> according to the example of their King, fought ſtoutly, and though there were 5000 of them killed, they ſlew as many of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But the King loſt his life in this Battel of <hi>Fluddon</hi> Field. He was ſo zealous for the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Pope, the ſtile of <hi>Protector of the Faith.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>James</hi> the V. a Child, ſucceeds his Father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral Regents. At laſt the diſtractions of the Kingdom forced the Nobility to invite over from <hi>France John Stuart,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> 1514. to take upon him the Government of the King and Kingdom. He was a wiſe and moderate man, but much addicted to the <hi>French</hi> faction and intereſt. He was a Nephew of King <hi>James</hi> the III. by his Brother <hi>Alexander.</hi> It was the unhappineſs of this, and ſeveral of the former Kings, to come to their Crown before they had knowledge and ability to bear them: therefore diviſions and factions in the State, between great and Ambitious Men, did miſerably tear, that poor Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:45285:149"/>and cauſed many calamities to fall upon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Inhabitants. When King <hi>James</hi> the V. came to be of Age, he viſited, with a fleet, all the Iſlands, and puniſhed ſuch diſorderly Rebels as regarded not his Predeceſſors commands. He went over into <hi>France,</hi> and marryed firſt <hi>Magdalen,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Daughter; but ſhe dyed ſuddenly. He marryed next with <hi>Mary,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> of whom was born that excellent Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Rebellious Subjects, and over-jealous Kinſwoman, brought her after much affliction, and a long impriſonment, to an undeſerved Death. She was conveyed into <hi>France,</hi> and marryed to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and her mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Regent in <hi>Scotland.</hi> About this time happened great troubles all over that Kingdom, by the bringing in of the Proteſtant Reformation, which was oppoſed by the Queen Regent and her <hi>French</hi> Faction, with the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy; but much encouraged by the People, the Gentry and Nobility; and eſpecially by <hi>James,</hi> a Baſtard Son of <hi>James</hi> the V. who leaving the command of his Cloyſter, was created by his Siſter Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Earl of <hi>Murrey.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was not wanting to the Proteſtant party in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſhe ſent them both Men and Money, and by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> were driven out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> after the death of her Husband, the <hi>French</hi> King, returns, by ſhipping, to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where ſhe found the Religion of the Country changed by an Act of Parliament, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith aboliſhed. Though the Queen had the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the <hi>Maſs</hi> in her own Chappel, the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Zeal of the reformed party was ſcandalous and unſufferable, for they offered many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45285:150"/>to the Queens Domeſticks of the <hi>Roman</hi> perſuaſion. Therefore to ſtrengthen her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a contrary faction, ſhe calls home <hi>Mathew Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> where he had lived in Exile. This Noble Man brought with him a Son, named <hi>Henry,</hi> commonly called the Lord <hi>Darly,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where as ſoon as the Queen fixed her Eyes upon him, ſhe choſe him for her Husband, and dignified him with the Dukedom of <hi>Rotheſay,</hi> and Earldom of <hi>Roſs,</hi> to make him a fitter match for a Queen. He was a perſon of admirable and comely preſence, and a zealous <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick. After he was marryed, and proclaimed King, many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility grew diſcontented, and fell into ſeveral parties, labouring to breed a difference between the King and Queen, which they found means to effect, after the King had cauſed <hi>David Riz,</hi> her <hi>French</hi> Secretary, to be violently carryed away from the Queens preſence, and murdered, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then big with Child. Afterwards ſhe was brought to bed in <hi>Edinburg</hi> Caſtle of a Son, named <hi>James,</hi> who, after the deceaſe of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> united both Kingdoms, and put an end to the quarrels of both Nations. The Queens Husband was afterwards inhumanely murdered by Earl <hi>Bothwel</hi> and other Conſpirators. The diſtreſſed Queen, after many hazards and troubles, flies for ſhelter into <hi>England,</hi> where, inſtead of a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, ſhe finds a Priſon and Death. King <hi>James,</hi> though Crowned young, and governed by his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle <hi>Murrey,</hi> proved one of the moſt excellent Princes for Wiſdom, Learning, and all other Princely Endowments that ever any Nation was bleſſed with. He was firſt govern'd by his Unkle <hi>Murrey,</hi> but he being ſhot by one <hi>Hamilton</hi> in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45285:150"/>Streets of <hi>Lithgo,</hi> and killed; <hi>Mathew Lenox,</hi> the young Kings Grandfather, was made Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi> during his Minority; but he being alſo killed at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the Earls <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Mar</hi> were appointed to ſucceed But when the King was twelve years of Age, he took upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was aſſiſted by twelve Noble Men, as Councellours. Then his Kinſman <hi>Eſmerus Stuart</hi> the Son of <hi>John,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Mathew,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> came over from <hi>France</hi> to viſit his Couſin King <hi>James,</hi> and was by him highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, made Lord Chamberlain of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lenox.</hi> His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for his extraordinary Valour at the Battel of <hi>Baugy</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had the Noble ſeat of <hi>Aubigny</hi> beſtowed upon him by the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the VII.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>James</hi> met with many difficulties and ſnares, out of which Providence, and his own diſcretion led him ſafe to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to the great Joy and Happineſs of both Kingdoms. He marryed with <hi>Anne,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and by her had two Sons. Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who was the great expectation of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation, but ſuddenly ſnatcht away by death. Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> marryed to the Prince Palatine of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> Succeſſour to his Father, and Heir of three flouriſhing Kingdoms, after many Battels, where he ſhewed his undaunted Courage, as well as Piety, in his Afflictions, was by a moſt unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, moſt devilliſh and unparalell'd Rebellion mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his Subjects. Never any Prince was better qualified for a Crown, never any more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in diſtreſs. Inſtead of the Imperial Crown of theſe Realms, Providence beſtowed upon him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45285:151"/>the Crown of Martyrdom, and his memory will ever continue precious in the remembrance of all his Loyal Subjects. He was too much a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to continue long in Peace, Governour over ſuch a tumultuous People. This Nation hath been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py many years in excellent, wiſe and valiant Princes, who have protected us and our Eſtates from forrein and inteſtine Enemies. Our late King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. of ever bleſſed Memory, was drawn into the Field betimes to contend with Cruelty, Rebellion and Tyranny: when to the loſs of his Patrimony, was added the loſs of ſo good a Father, and the Baniſhment of his Friends, his excellent Courage was not dejected, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo many aggravations of Sorrow, under ſo many preſſing and grievous Afflictions as were ſent to welcom him into the World, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to recover, by his Valour and Conduct, his Kingdoms and Crowns. In <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he was to ſtruggle with a ſeditious and troubleſome Generation, and was to encounter with a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Army of Enemies; his Wiſdom preſerved his divided party from that ruine, into which they were falling by their needleſs Factions; and at the unhappy Battel of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> ſhewed himſelf to be a wiſe and diligent Commander, and an undaunted Soldier, by the confeſſion of his greateſt Enemies. But that which this brave Prince attempted to obtain by his juſt Arms, Providence procured to him by a Miracle; I mean, the Reſtauration of the Royal Family to their Dignities and Eſtates, without any effuſion of Bloud, when there were ſo many Enemies both at home and abroad to oppoſe them.</p>
                     <p>In this ſhort ſummary of the Heroes of the Royal Family, I cannot but mention our preſent
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45285:151"/>King <hi>James</hi> the II. whoſe great Courage, undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit, and Noble Mind, hath been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tryed both at at home and abroad, both by Sea and Land, againſt Foreign Enemies in the Field, and furious and unreaſonable Combitations of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Spirits within the Kingdom. Victory and ſucceſs hath always attended upon him; and may this moſt Excellent Prince long continue over us in all proſperity and happineſs, and may his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies lick the duſt.</p>

The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> in contempt of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s youthful days, ſent him, in ſcorn, a Tunn of Tennis Balls to play with.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45285:152"/>wanting in Ability, may be made good by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and policy. King <hi>Henry,</hi> for the obtaining of his purpoſe, tranſported over an Army into <hi>France. Harflew</hi> was beſieged, and within ſix Weeks taken. The Soldiers had liberty to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. A ſudden diſtemper happened in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, which deſtroyed many of the ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Soldiers, who are as much ſubject to death in their Tents, as in the midſt of the Enemies Swords, and the ſhowres of ſhot. The King left a Garriſon in <hi>Harflew,</hi> and reſolved by land to march to <hi>Chalice</hi> with Two Thouſand Horſe, and Thirteen Thouſand Archers. The <hi>Dolphin</hi> with above Thirty Thouſand at <hi>Rohan</hi> reſolved in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to ſight the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> At <hi>Agencourt</hi> the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>France</hi> came to the <hi>Dolphin</hi> with Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and ſome Foot. The <hi>French,</hi> as their manner is, boaſted of the Victory before they had got it; but they preſumed ſo much upon their numbers, that they thought to ſwallow up the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> had wiſely provided all things for a Fight. He had got a number of Stakes, ſtrengthned with ſharp Irons at each end; with them he fences in his Foot, that they might find, in caſe of neceſſity, ſome defence againſt the multitudes of the Enemies Horſe. The <hi>French</hi> Army was divided into three Battalions, the firſt conſiſting of 16000. was lead by the Conſtable; the ſecond, by the Dukes of <hi>Alanſon</hi> and <hi>Barr;</hi> the third was commanded by the Earls of <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Damp.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vanguard was brought up by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the main Battel, in which were the ſtrongeſt Bill-men, by the King, aſſiſted by the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Suffolk.</hi> The Rear was marſhalled by the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Kings Unkle. An Ambuſh of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:45285:152"/>Archers was placed within a new hedge, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ſurprize the <hi>French</hi> at their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. They did ſuch good ſervice with their ſhowres of Arrows, which fell upon the Van of the <hi>French</hi> Army, conſiſting for the moſt part of Horſe, that they were overthrown, and helped to trample upon, and diſorder their Foot. In that hurly burly the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill-men fell upon them with ſuch fury, that they were forced to fly: but at the coming in of the <hi>French</hi> main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> retreated in order within their Stakes, and where then followed by the <hi>French</hi> Horſe with more haſt than diſcretion, for they found themſelves ſo entangled, that many of the moſt furious loſt their Lives. Here the King fought hand to hand with the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> and beat him down, and would have ſpared his Life, had not his Guard killed him before he was aware. When the two firſt Battalions were overthrown, the third had no ſtomack to go on to the charge; and though they were the greater number, they fled, and craved quarter, which was granted: but when a dreadful noiſe was heard from the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Camp, occaſioned by 600 Horſe that fell in to plunder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> behind their Backs; the King imagining that another Army was coming on to aſſault him, and that ſo many thouſand Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might riſe up, and endanger his Army in the Rear, commanded them all to be flain, for which he ever after was heartily ſorry. In this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ſell the Conſtable and Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Alanſon, Brabant</hi> and <hi>Barre,</hi> many Earls, 25 Barons, 8000 Knights, Eſquires, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and many thouſand common Soldiers. Though the Enemy was fled, the King, for the publick ſafety, commanded his Army to ſtand in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45285:153"/>Array; for the Earl of <hi>Faulconbridge</hi> ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with 600 Horſe, to take the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon an advantage, but they were ſoon routed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, Solemn thanks was given there to God; and the Soldiers had then liberty to take the Plunder of the Field. From thence King <hi>Henry</hi> marched to <hi>Chalice,</hi> loaden with Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The next year, with a new Army, he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Normandy,</hi> beſieged and took <hi>Caen,</hi> and all the chief Towns, invited by the Kings promiſes, yielded without reſiſtance; only <hi>Rohan,</hi> being well manned and fortified, held out ſo long, till Famine ſcal'd the Walls, and deliver'd it to the <hi>Engliſh, Bedford</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> returned like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Victory over the <hi>French</hi> Fleet.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of this War, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no aſſiſtance, but from their own Skill and Valour, and from the divided State of <hi>France,</hi> and the diſcontent of the Grandees, who commonly find fault with one another in an unſucceſsful War. But there happened an Action which mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the ſtrength of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the <hi>Dolphins</hi> Enemy, ſought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him for the publick good. The <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> though he profeſſed much kindneſs, took his advantage, and murdered the Duke. The Earl of <hi>Carolois;</hi> the Dukes eldeſt Son, ſought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on the Murderers, and therefore from thence favoured King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Claim. A peace was concluded, by which King <hi>Henry</hi> was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Regent, and Heir apparent of <hi>France,</hi> and he marryed with <hi>Catherine,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All theſe ſudden ſucceſſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were owing to the young Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, the <hi>French</hi> Kings weakneſs, and the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> unjuſt dealing; for he had purchaſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45285:153"/>many Enemies by the illegal murdering of great men, chiefly the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> A Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy hath a great advantage in a ſtrange Country, when a Potent Perſon, or a conſiderable Party joins with; or aſſiſts them in their Conqueſt. The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> though he was diſcouraged by the <hi>French</hi> Kings rejection, and the defection of many Towns, he gathered his Forces, and put a period to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Victories and Joys, by the gain of a Battel, wherein 2000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſurprized and ſlain, with the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Earls of <hi>Tankerville</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> only for want of a right intelligence of the Enemies ſtate and numbers.

In the proſecution of this War many Towns were loſt and taken on both ſides; ſeveral ſharp encounters happened between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Garriſons.

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen this excellent General came firſt to the Government of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the Seventeen Provinces, was in poſſeſſion but of three of the leaſt, but in a few years <hi>Parma,</hi> by his induſtry and skill in Arms, recovered almoſt all, <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This Prince had given the firſt Specimen of his Courage and Underſtanding in War in the Famous Battel of <hi>Lepanto</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> where he adventur'd to board a great Commanders Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, named <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> the Treaſurer of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and after a bloudy Fight, he took that Gally, and another that came in to aſſiſt the former, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Riches in both. But when <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtriae</hi> was ſent Governour into the <hi>netherlands,</hi> he invited <hi>Alexander,</hi> the young Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> into the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> At the Battel of <hi>Gemblack</hi> between <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the States, <hi>Alexander</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Enemies Horſe to march in a crooked and uneven way, gave notice of it to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and without expecting any return, cauſed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45285:155"/>ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders to aſſault them in the Front, and upon the Flanks, which was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with that Gallantry, that they were put to flight, and run back upon their Foot, which they broke and diſorder'd, ſo that 10000 were there ſlain and taken in half an Hours time, and but nine of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army were found wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. All their Carriages and Guns were there taken, with their General, and ſeveral Noblemen. This great Victory procured the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> the favour and eſteem of all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army. But as the chief skill of a General conſiſts not only in knowing when, and how to overcome an Enemy; but alſo in underſtanding how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Army, and ſaving it from a dangerous poſt, or drawing it out of the unexpected Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes of a powerful Enemy; this was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlin:</hi> for <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General, having ſuffered a conſiderable part of his Army to fall upon the Enemies, they retreated to their great Guns, and had encompaſſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> round, ſo that they had been all cut in pieces, had not <hi>Parma</hi> ſecured their Retreat, which he did, by placing behind the Hedges ſome Companies of Musketiers to ſtop the purſuing Enemy, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome Troops of Horſe furiouſly to charge, whilſt he gave a private ſign for a Retreat, and drew away the Body of Foot, in danger to be loſt, into the narrow ways, lined with his Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keteers. In the mean while orders were given to the reſt of the Army to keep their Ranks, and to ſtand ready to ſhelter their Fellows at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, for fear the Enemy, following cloſe at the Rear, ſhould diſorder and rout the whole Army, as it hath often happened in ſuch like caſes.</p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:45285:155"/>
                     <p>When <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was dead, <hi>Alexander</hi> ſucceeded him in the Government of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and in the chief command of the Army. <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> was firſt beſieged by him, where he ſo cunningly encloſed in the Town with Forts and Works by Land, and two Bridges over the River <hi>Moſa,</hi> that it was not in the power of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and of his Army, either to relieve the Town, or force him in his Trenches. At laſt, after a notable Siege, the City was taken, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably plundred by the Dukes Army. By his Policy and Valour he recover'd the moſt part of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> defeated the Troops of <hi>Caſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince, who, with his <hi>German</hi> Forces, aſſiſted the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the States. He compelled ſeveral great Towns to yield to him, <hi>Tourney, Aldenard, Dunkirk, &amp;c.</hi> He drove the Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> out of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and often beat the <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their unhappy endeavour to ſurprize <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and the chief Towns, which they aſſaulted at noon day, by the orders of the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> who attempted to take and plunder <hi>Antwerp</hi> by Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. But <hi>Parma</hi>'s excellent skill in War never appeared more than in the famous Siege of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp:</hi> With ten or eleven thouſand men he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagur'd that great City full of People, defeated all the Auxiliary Forces ſent to relieve the Town, and at the ſame time compelled Five other ſtrong Cities to yield to him, <hi>Gant, Bruſſels, Mechlin, Nimeguen,</hi> and <hi>Teneramund.</hi> In this Siege he built a Famous and moſt Ingenious Bridge over the River of <hi>Scala.</hi> This Bridge was in part blown up and broken by Ships let down the Stream from <hi>Antwerp</hi> by a notable Ingenier; but ſuch was the diligence and Courage of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45285:156"/>ſome Beams, Planks and Veſſels to be laid in that Breach, and Drums and Trumpets there to ſound, to blind and deceive the <hi>Holland</hi> Veſſels that were coming up the River the next morning to relieve <hi>Antwerp</hi> with Proviſions: ſo that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diſcouragement, and the loſs of his Soldiers, killed in the blowing up of the Bridge, he continued the Siege, until the Citizens were forced by Famine to yield up their City. He reduced the States of <hi>Holland</hi> to the neceſſity of imploring Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Aid. She ſent ſent the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> with a brave Army; but the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> proceeded on in the Conqueſt of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the taking of ſeveral Towns both from the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But no Action of this Prince deſerves more the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men, than his expeditions into <hi>France.</hi> The firſt was for the relief of <hi>Paris,</hi> beſieged by <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. The Duke was ordered by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to march thither with his Army. <hi>Henry</hi> was forced to call together all his Troops, and riſe from the Siege, to meet the Duke, with an intent to fight him. But when he underſtood that <hi>Paris</hi> was ſupplyed with Proviſions, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched himſelf in ſuch an advantagious Poſt, that the King did not dare to beat him from thence. He afterwards retreated back into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and in view of the <hi>French</hi> Army (far more numerous than his) ſtormed and took the Town of <hi>Lagny;</hi> and though the <hi>French</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him cloſe at the Heels, yet he ordered his Retreat ſo ſubtilely, that they could never fight him. The next expedition was for the Relief of <hi>Rohan,</hi> beſieged by ſame King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. The Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> with an Army of about 15000 Old Soldiers, <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Walloons,</hi> and 8000
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45285:156"/>
                        <hi>French,</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> went to <hi>Rohan,</hi> and obliged King <hi>Henry</hi> to depart with his Army. <hi>Parma,</hi> at the requeſt of the Citizens, aſſaulted <hi>Caudebeck,</hi> and took it. In the mean while King <hi>Henry</hi> had gathered together his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed Forces, and finding himſelf as ſtrong as his Enemies, reſolved to purſue, and fight them. They were then about <hi>Tuepot</hi> in the Chalky Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Normandy,</hi> having the great River of <hi>Seine</hi> between them both. The Dukes Army was much diſtreſſed for want of Victuals, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome loſs by the <hi>French</hi> Army in Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes; and King <hi>Henry</hi> had taken great care to cut off all proviſions from them. But the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> in one night, deliver'd his Army from the danger both of the Enemy and of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. He cauſed great Boats, covered over with Beams and Planks, to fall down the River from <hi>Rohan</hi> to his Camp, where he cauſed two Forts to be raiſed, with ſome Redoubts, to favour and defend his paſſage over the River, which in this place is half a League over. Upon theſe Boats he conveyed over all his Cannon and Carriages, his Bag and Baggage, with Horſe and Foot; ſo that the next day, when the <hi>French</hi> Army was preparing to aſſault the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Tents, they ſaw only Prince <hi>Ranuſe Farneſe</hi> with 1500 Men, with the reſt of their Canon, going over to the Dukes Army on the other ſide; and it was not in the Kings power to follow him for want of Boats, or a Bridge. By this means the Duke returned back with leiſure into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> relieved two great Cities againſt a powerful King; and without venturing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to the great wonder of all <hi>Europe,</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med what he had undertaken.</p>

                     <p>THis excellent Commander, by the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s order, marched out of <hi>Lovain,</hi> where he was Governour, towards <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> to diſcover the Enemy, and by chance met with five Companies of Foot, and Seven Hundred Horſe. At the firſt ſight his men began to fear the in-equality of the number; but the Marquiſs finding himſelf too far advanced, and ſo near that he could not well eſcape by flight, reſolved, to encourage his ſmall party to ſtand the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For that purpoſe he cauſed his <hi>Carabines</hi> to march up to the top of the Hill in ſight of the Enemy, and there to ſtand ready for a charge, whilſt he divided his <hi>Lances</hi> into three parts, which he cauſed, at a ſignal given, to ride from three ſeveral places furiouſly towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. When they ſaw from divers places ſeveral Troops of Horſe riding up to charge them, and hearing the ſound of the Trumpets, which the Marquiſs cauſed to be ſounded in the Vallies, as if there were a greater Body of Men coming up to charge them, they all run away, and gave an eaſie Victory to the Marquiſs, who in half an hours time killed a great many in the purſuit, took three Colours, two hundred Horſes, and and one hundred Priſoners. Thus, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45285:157"/>and deceit of the eye-ſight, was this party routed; and when fear cauſeth Men to fly away, a ſmall number is ſufficient to continue the chaſe, and hinder them from rallying.</p>

Francfort, Ausburg, Monachium,</hi> and many of the chief Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> were ſurrendred to the King, who met with no reſiſtance, till <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> Duke of <hi>Fridland,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with a great Army, encamped near the <hi>Swedes</hi> about <hi>Noremburg.</hi> The Kings Army was 50000 ſtrong, the Imperialiſts more; but the <hi>Swedes</hi> wanted Proviſions, which they took by intercepting ſuch Convoys as were going to the Emperours Army, and by ſurprizing <hi>Frieſtad,</hi> a Magazine. The King ſends <hi>Tupatelius,</hi> a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Collonel, with a party of Dragoons in the Night. They clapt a Petard to the Gates, and entred the Town, took the Corn and the Cattle that were there; and becauſe the Enemies Army lay not far off, the King ſent a ſtrong party
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45285:160"/>to relieve his Men, placing an Ambuſh for the Imperialiſts, who failed not to fall into it, to their great loſs. Both Armies thundred one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another many days with frequent Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, but the want of Proviſions forced them to part after a hot Encounter. The Imperialiſts marched towards <hi>Saxony,</hi> to be revenged on that Duke. With the Dread and Terror of Fire and Sword they opened the Gates of many ſtrong Towns, till the King, haſting to the Aſſiſtance of that miſerable Country, at the fatal Town of <hi>Lutzen,</hi> the 6th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1632. he meets with the Imperial Army, and reſolves to fight them. As ſoon as the Sun was up, he implored the Aſſiſtance of the Almighty, and ſet his Army in order; he himſelf led the Right Wing, the Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Saxon Weymar</hi> had the Left. The King was deſired to put on his Armour, but he refuſed to incumber himſelf with ſo great a Weight. In the heat of the Battel, a certain perſon, belonging to the Regiment of <hi>Piccollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> ſees him at a diſtance; he rid furiouſly up to him, and as he was turning about his Horſe, he ſhot him with a Brace of Bullets in the Back, to the great grief of all his Army, but not to their Diſcouragement; for when they heard of his Death, they fell ſo reſolutely on, that they beat off the Imperialiſts, and recovered the Royal Body. In the Left Wing Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> had put the Enemy to a Retreat, but at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Papenheim,</hi> an Imperial General, came into the Field, rallyed the diſordered Troops, and with his own Forces endeavoured to ſnatch the Victory from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but he ſound them ready to receive him. The day was too ſhort for that Fight, it continued ſome part of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45285:160"/>night; but <hi>Papenheim</hi> ended there his days in the Bed of Honour, leaving the <hi>Swedes</hi> to rejoice for a dear bought Victory, with the loſs of an excellent King, who dyed in the 38th. year of his Age. When he ſaw how fond and confident his People were in him, he deſired them not to truſt in him, whoſe Breath was in his Noſtrils, but in the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who had promiſed to be with his Church till the end of the World. Though the <hi>Swedes</hi> here loſt their King, they proſecuted the War under the command of Duke <hi>Bernard, Kniphus</hi> and <hi>Horn,</hi> being aſſiſted by the Dukes of <hi>Saxony, Brandenburg,</hi> the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg.</hi>

                     <p>THe King had in his Army about eight or nine thouſand Men.

                  <head>A DISCOURSE OF ENGINES USED IN WAR.</head>
                  <p>THere is no art nor knowledge where the Wit of Man hath been more active than in that of War, and found out more wonderful and ſtrange Inventions, both for Offence and Defence, to inable him to perform things beyond his ordinary and natural Strength. Either the greatneſs of the Rewards, and advantage propoſed, or the neceſſities unto which he hath bin reduced, or the importance of War, upon which depend oſtimes the happineſs or miſery of whole Kingdoms and Nations, have ſharpned his contriving Faculty in this, more than in other concerns of this humane Life.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45285:178"/>The <hi>Romans,</hi> for the encreaſe of their Empire, and the ſubduing many Warlike Nations, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them by the politick order of their Militia, and took their ſtrongeſt Caſtles by Inventions of the Wits of that Age. At the firſt beſieging of a Town, they were wont to fortifie themſelves in their Trenches, to prevent all ſudden Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes or Sallies; then did they encompaſs in the Town with Forts, Lines and Trenches to hinder all Supplies and Proviſions from going to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. Afterwards they made uſe of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to force them to yield. They raiſed a high Mount with Earth and Faggots, higher than the Walls, to fight with greater advantage; this was called <hi>Agger.</hi> They uſed alſo Towers of Wood, which they could draw ſo near the Enemies Walls, that they often leaped from them into the City. <hi>Lucanus</hi> mentions them both at the Siege of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> by <hi>Coeſar,</hi> Lib. 3. <hi>Stellatis Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibus Agger erigitur, geminaſqe equantes maenia Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res accipit: hae nullo fixerunt robore terram, ſed per iter longam repſere latenti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Baliſtae</hi> were Inventions to caſt great Stones of a vaſt bigneſs, or a number of Arrows with that ſtrength, that nothing could well ſtand before them; for the weight of the ſtones caſt violently upon the Enemy, did cruſh and beat them to pieces, and the ſhowrs of Arrows flying out of this Engine with an incredible Violence, did great execution. The ſame Poet deſcribes it,</p>

                     <l>—Tenſo Balliſtae turbine rapta</l>

                     <l>Sed pandens perque arma viam, perque oſſa, relicta</l>
                     <l>Morte fugit: ſupereſt telo poſt vulnera curſus.</l>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Teſtudo</hi> was another Invention to ſecure their way to the Walls, or to their Towers, from the Enemies Arrows. It was made like a Penthouſe, ſupported with Beams, and covered over with raw Hides; but this word is often taken for a continued number of Bucklers, held up together by the Soldiers, when they were marching under the Enemies Walls, by which they did protect their Heads from great Stones, and other weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things caſt upon them. The <hi>Romans Vinea</hi> was another Engine uſed by them, when they were to undermine, or work at the foot of the Walls, to overthrow them. It was made of Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Planks, and ſometimes covered over with raw hides, to prevent burning. The Soldiers were ſecured under it from the Enemies Darts and violent endeavours. But when the Army gave a general Aſſault, they had another Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, named <hi>Muſculi,</hi> to cover their Bodies in the approach. <hi>Pluteus,</hi> was another Engine, not much unlike to a <hi>Vinea.</hi> Theſe differing names are borrowed from the ſhapes and forms which theſe ſeveral Contrivances had. Now for offence, beſides the fore-named <hi>Baliſtae,</hi> they made uſe of an Engine called <hi>Onager,</hi> to caſt Stones with great violence, and another Invention named <hi>Scorpio,</hi> to fling Darts againſt the Enemies, and <hi>Falces Murales,</hi> to pull down the Stones of a Wall, and level the breach for a more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſault. But there was no Inſtrument more uſeful to them than their <hi>Aries,</hi> ſo named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45285:179"/>it was headed with Iron, not much unlike to Rams Horns; it was a great beam, weighed and lifted up, and forced againſt the Walls of a Town, ſometimes by the ſtrength of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with Ropes and Powlies, ſometimes by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Contrivance. This <hi>Aries</hi> did commonly batter down the ſtrongeſt and thickeſt Walls of Morter and Stone; therefore <hi>Coeſar</hi> obſerves that, ſome of the Cities of the <hi>Gauls</hi> were builded with Beams acroſs, to ſtrengthen them againſt the violent impulſe of this great and ſtrong En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, of which the Poet ſpeaks,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Nunc Aries ſuſpenſo fatior ictu</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Moſt of theſe Engines, and others, uſed by the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> in their Wars, are now out of date, becauſe our Warfare in theſe days is altogether another thing, by reaſon of the Invention of Gunpowder and Guns. And the Wit of Man hath proceeded further than ever they did to find out ſtrange Inſtruments of a greater ſtrength, and more powerful operation. I ſhall here give a brief account of the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Engines and Inventions now commonly us'd in War.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of Great Guns.</head>
                     <p>Since the Invention of Gunpowder, Guns have been found to be more ſerviceable, and eaſie to command and procure, then other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons before uſed in their ſtead. And for Great Guns, they ſtrike a Terror into the Enemy with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45285:179"/>their dreadful noiſe and thundering, and are more commodious than either the <hi>Romans</hi> Ram, or their <hi>Baliſta,</hi> for to do execution upon Men or Walls; but though it is of great uſe, yet there is this defect in Great Guns, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo eaſily managed, as to be brought to play ſo ſoon and ſo ſpeedily as ſudden occaſions may require. Their Fury is to be avoided by the nimbleneſs of the Foot, or by the Galloping of the Horſe. If therefore it were poſſible to find out ſuch an Invention as may add to the ſtrength of a Great Gun the ſwiftneſs of a Horſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is no body of Horſe or Foot could be able to reſiſt a ſmall party furniſhed therewith. Such things may be found out as may be of great uſe in time of need. But there are ſeveral ſorts of great Guns: theſe are the ordinary Names, with their uſual proportions.</p>
                     <p>The Canon is about 11, 12, or 13 foot long, of 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 Inches Diameter. If the Shot weighs 110 pounds, there is required of Corn Powder 76 Pounds for to charge the Gun, and ſo proportionable of the bigger or leſſer Cannon.</p>
                     <p>The Dragon of Double Culvering weighs 14000 pounds, and ſhoots 357 paces level, 4252 paces at random</p>
                     <p>The whole Culvering weighs 8500 pounds, is about 13 Foot and a quarter long, ſhoots level 415 paces, and at random about 3700 paces.</p>
                     <p>The Demi-Culvering weighs 4600 pounds, is about 9 or 10 Foot long, ſhoots level 235 paces.</p>
                     <p>The Saker Ordinary is about 9 Foot and a half long, weighs 2650 pounds, ſhoots level 183 paces.</p>
                     <p>The Sakeret, or <hi>Minion,</hi> is about 8 Foot long.</p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:45285:180"/>
                     <p>The Fawlcon weighs 1500 pounds, ſhoots le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel 889 paces.</p>
                     <p>The Fawlconet weighs 850 pounds, ſhoots le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel 107 paces.</p>
                     <p>The Rabinet weighs 425 pounds, ſhoots level 82 paces, and at random 669 paces.</p>
                     <p>The Baſe weighs 300 pounds, ſhoots level 63 paces, and at random 525 paces.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that theſe ſeveral kinds of Great Ordinance are ſometimes of a leſs or greater weight, and according to the force of the Metal, they will bear a greater or leſs charge.

                     <p>This is a moſt dreadful Engine, commonly uſed to break down Walls, Houſes, and to fire Cities. It doth execution where the Canon can never reach. It is commonly made of Braſs, or Pot Metal, and ſometimes of Canvas, to ſet fire upon Houſes and Towns. They of Braſs are to be filled with ſtrong Powder, with a ſnout at one end, and a hole at the other, where there muſt be a ſlow burning powder, made of Canon Powder, beaten and moiſtned with the Oyl of <hi>Peter,</hi> mingled with Charcole. They are caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air out of a Morter-piece into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cities or Caſtles; and they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of that Weight, that they will brake through the Tiling and Heads of Houſes, and when they break, caſt down the Walls on both ſides, and ſet all a fire that is combuſtible.

                     <p>Fire-balls are very uſeful in the Siege, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Towns. They muſt be ſhot out of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpieces or Canon. They are to be made in this manner; Take Gooſe-Greaſe or Swines Greaſe, one part of Tar, half a quarter as much of pitch, two parts of ſtrong Brandy, half a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45285:181"/>quarter of Linſeed Oil, one part of Verdigreaſe a quarter part of Wax, half a quarter of Groom, a quarter part of Salt-Peter, and Meal one part; all this muſt be ſtirred together over a ſlow Fire till it comes to be well mixed, then caſt in ſome Tow and Linen Rags, which muſt be rowled in ſmall beaten powder, and then round about, four, five or ſix long and ſharp Irons, joined together in the middle: when the Ball is as big as you deſign it, you muſt bind it faſt with Wire or Packthread, and bore two, or four, or more holes through and through, which muſt be filled with good bruiſed Powder that may eaſily take Fire. Some Fire-balls are made round, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch ſharp Irons ſticking; but if planks or boards are to be fired, thoſe with Irons are the moſt proper for execution; for where they fall, they ſtick ſo faſt, that they are not eaſily to be removed, till the place be conſumed where they unhappily light.</p>

                     <p>At the boarding of Ships the Enemy throws not only Hand-Granado's and Fire-balls, but there is a new Invention, certain Pots filled with moſt odious and noiſom ſtuff, together with Wildfire and other Ingredients, which are caſt into the port-holes of Ships, or into the Steerage or Fore-Caſtle, which, when they break, grievouſly wound the Defendants, and fill the Room with ſuch ſtrange Fumes, that ſcarce any perſon can ſuffer them.</p>

                     <p>This Invention is very good to defend a Breach, or to flank a Body of Pikes. The Frame is made of Planks, with three or four ſtories high, having ſo many Tire of Muskets, and a ſmall Spout of Braſs to go from one touch-hole to another; ſo that as ſoon as the Train is fired, the whole Tyre muſt needs go off. When Men grow ſcarce in a Siege, through Sickneſs, or otherwiſe, this Invention may be of great uſe, for it may be ſo made, that two or three Men may manage forty or fifty Muskets at a Bridge, or a breach, and with greater ſafety to their own Perſons, that may be covered behind out of danger of the Invading Enemy's ſmall ſhot.</p>
